0,"I fully agree that people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , either because they think that they do not have the time or because they are money-tormented or because they think that they are not going to be able to make any drastic changes .",give;have,8;24
1,"People in past , however , use to dedicate time , money and effort for community service .",dedicate,8
2,"Some fellow students think that they do not have time to join an NGO and to help in raising money for the poor , because they do not follow a schedule .",have;follow,8;28
3,"Their time is eaten up by studying or by lazing about and when they are asked to make a few contributions such as helping in raising money for the poor or organizing a certain event , they would think that this is going to prevent them from getting good grades .",eaten;up,3;4
4,Some people are too money-tormented .,,
5,For them time is money .,time;is;money,2;3;4
6,So they do not want to waste their time by helping their communities .,waste,6
7,"I once tried to recruit a few people in order to teach some illiterate children , how to read and write .",,
8,The question I was asked was how much they were going to be paid and when they knew that it was for free the declined .,,
9,"When I reminded them of Doria Shafeek , an eminent feminist who used to buy children presents out of her own money to make them attend her reading and writing classes , they just shrugged their shoulders .",shrugged;shoulders,34;36
10,"Other people think that irrespective of the time and effort , they are going to put into helping their communities , they will not be able to effect any changes .",put;into,15;16
11,i can remember a girl who was asked to join a Red Cross training course and she was of the opinion that she was not skillful enough .,,
12,The woman responsible for recruiting people gave her a book on Florence Nightingale and how she started from scratch and what difference she made in the field of nursing and she talked to her about pampered women of society and princesses who used to pride themselves on how they learned how to nurse casualties of war .,from;scratch;pampered,17;18;35
13,This really boosted the girl s morale and made her join the course .,boosted,2
14,"Poeple do not give enough time for their communities , either because they are too busy or they are ignorant to the benefits they are going to reap or the difference they are going to make .",give;reap,3;27
15,I think there should be more conscience raising sessions to point out to people how important working for their community is,conscience,6
16,I do not think traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .,,
17,There are some reasons I do not prefer .,,
18,"First , tour will limit us where to go .",limit,4
19,Although it will be much cheaper than going alone the tour might not be as what you have thought .,,
20,"You might want to see around other places but since it is moving with group , you will not able to go by only your feelings .",,
21,"Secondly , the tour guide will decide the time they are looking , so you are not able to see it as long as you want .",,
22,"Different from traveling by yourself , a tour wants to go many place as possible to have more customers .",,
23,So they are not able to take enough time to see each place because they have to go next on time .,take;on,6;19
24,"This might be OK for some people , but others might think they are not satisfied .",,
25,"Thirdly , there will be many other people that you do not know each other .",,
26,This will make you feel tired and no privacy .,,
27,"It will make you feel tired by It is not only by yourself , so you have to make rules to have the trip smooth .",smooth,24
28,"But for any reason you are going to the trip , I think they want to get away from every day life .",,
29,So this will not let you feel freely if you have to make rules .,,
30,"From these reasons , I prefer traveling by ourselves might be the best way to travel .",,
31,"Traveling by ourselves might cost higher , but you are able to plan the trip freely as you think and do what ever you want to make it satisfied .",,
32,I am sure this kind of trip will be greater than going in a group led by a tour guide .,,
33,"For me , it is better to have a specialize in one specific subject than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is easier for normal human study one subject and spend his time on it .",broad;spend,16;33
34,People who prepare studying one languages sue donothave time for that because there is many things in life take bolt of human s time .,have;take,9;20
35,One reason that a human could have any social problems make him confused and not consetrating on his studying so it is better for him to study one subject .,consetrating,15
36,Also studying one subject make human successful in what he is studying .,,
37,"For example , if a person studied business administration and spend all his time and energy for it he will became amazing in his career and job .",spend,10
38,If he had a little time he could take some courses of any thing he likes .,,
39,"On the other hand , having broad knowledge it s may be good to haver a well informations about many things in this life but i disagree to have many knowledge of many academic subjects because it is wasting for time espcially if the person has a familly and childrens , it would be difficult for him to take care of his family and his studying at the same time .",broad;wasting,6;38
40,the family need time to spend with because it s the main ting in this life and from the good family grow good peple .,spend;from;grow,5;17;21
41,But when one of the parents donothave time for thier family that would reflect in a negative way at childrens .,have;reflect,8;15
42,So studying one subject would allow person to have time for his own life and take care of it .,have,8
43,So having one thing to study is better for the pain him self also better for the country he live in .,,
44,"I think having one subject to so study or not , well ...",,
45,that depends in person s personality in his life and his scale .,,
46,Each person has his own idea .,,
47,"In the past in each school or university there was not specific subject , but the students had a knowledge of many subjects .",,
48,Today the number of course at university are increase because they would people specialized in one specific subject .,,
49,"In my opinion is better to have , in the first year of study , broad knowledge of generic materials , than specialized in one specific subject .",broad,15
50,In this method students are increasing their culture in their material very rapidly with very strenght ideas .,increasing;strenght,5;15
51,"Another point of this system , are that could increasing new post of work and new type of work .",,
52,"To complete my opinion , I agree to spend part of study for stage , it is more important because it is between study and work .",spend,8
53,"In summary today students can specialised in one specific subject , but the world of work remain too far , during this specialisation .",world;too;far,13;17;18
54,The issue of whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than the people who do only what they already know is interesting one .,,
55,"In my opinion , the successful people should have challenging spirits .",,
56,"First of all , the most succesfull people have been something of challengers to date .",,
57,"For example , Soichiro Honda , who was a founder of a Japanese car maker called HONDA , was a typical challenger .",,
58,"Before founding his company , he was a only owner of small cycle shop .",,
59,"But , he had a great ambition and strongly desired to help the people who were at a loss in mobility .",strongly,8
60,"Eventually , he invested the first motor cycle in Japan .",,
61,"It was not only his challenge , he endeavored many things after this and founded his company .",,
62,"Nowadays , HONDA has successes his challenging spirits and tried many new things , such as making robot called Asimo , investing hydrogen electric motor car etc .",,
63,"However , it is not necessarily that every challenging brings success every time .",,
64,"For example , about 100 years ago , there is a trade company called Suzuki Shoten in Japan .",,
65,The people who worked for this company were full of challenging spirits .,full,8
66,"But , unfortunately , their efforts went too far .",went;far,6;8
67,Their attitude which they tried something new and spend money on it lead this company to bankrupt .,lead,12
68,This was an example that challenging has not only advantage but also disadvantage .,,
69,"But , I can safely say that people never get the chance to be success if they only do what have been manualized and never want to take any risks because everybody can do the same things in the same way .",,
70,"In other word , nobody can stand out from the crowd without new challenging which make person distinguished from others .",stand;out;from;the;crowd,6;7;8;9;10
71,"In conclusion , only the people who made a lot of efforts to challeng something new can attain big success .",,
72,I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .,,
73,I bought a food with looking nice picture last week .,,
74,"Even though , when I cooked as exactly what the direction says , it looked different and it was not very nice .",,
75,Those kind of things should have happened to most people .,,
76,I understand that they are doing business and they are trying to get more customers and sell the products .,,
77,"However , I donotthing they should make advertisement make products seem better than they really are for three reasons .",,
78,"First , it makes people who bought the product disappointed .",,
79,The light used in the picture on the advertisement and angles can make the product looks better .,,
80,"In addition , if the customer did not like the real product , they wasted their money .",wasted,14
81,It is like cheating and not fair .,cheating,3
82,"Finally , the company might be complained by the customers .",,
83,The customers will not buy the same product if they are disappointed by the product which were showed nicer than they really are .,,
84,The product wil be popular only the begining and the profit will not get any better or get worse .,,
85,People are happy and dreaming when they are looking at the advertisement .,dreaming,4
86,It is true that nice looking advertisement make people feel good .,,
87,"Although , people get more desapointted and sad if the difference is so big .",,
88,"Nice and beautiful advertisement give people dream but if it is not true , it is cheating .",dream;cheating,6;16
89,It is not good to show not real looks .,,
90,"From my perspective , in twenty years time there will be fewer cars circulating above all in big cities .",,
91,There are a lot of reasons that make me argue it .,,
92,First of all cities are trying to improve more and more public transports : there are always projects for new and faster metropolitan lines which can link different city zones in a real short time .,,
93,"Moreover , pollution is becoming a problem even more dangerous for the health of everybody and all the diseases caused by pollution are making people aware of the necessity of an alternative to the use of the car and of other polluting private transports like motorcycles .",,
94,"Furthermore , having a car is always more and more expensive : taxation and insurance costs are also very high .",,
95,Beside the cost of oil is always growing and if you add the costs of the parking in central zones you can guess why always more people prefer public transports more than their own car .,growing,7
96,"Lastly also public transports like highspeed trains are being developed and I think that in a twenty years time all the major city of Europe will be reachable in a very short time , making useless the car also fo long journeys .",reachable,27
97,"However , problems remains in little cities where car is necessary in winter or in rainy day .",,
98,But here also car are becoming less and less popular .,,
99,Educational programs in primary school teach the children to prefer to go to school with bicycle or with the schoolbus instead of with their parents and their own car and are spreading a ecological conscience in new generations .,spreading;conscience,31;34
100,"As a conclusion , I believe that owning a car could be always useful , but the ecological awareness will make people use their car less .",,
101,"Even though sometimes , in particular when traveling for a short amount of time , being in an organized group with a guide can be more effective , I generally prefer to travel on my own .",,
102,"The main reason why I like traveling is the fact that it provides an opportunity to be close to very different people , learn a language and eat new , unusual food .",,
103,"In summary , to experience a different culture .",,
104,"When you travel in a group , you often end up with people from your country , who speak your language and want to eat known food , in known places .",end;up,9;10
105,"Also , tour guides generally focus on the typical tourist attractions , because that s what most people are interested in .",focus;attractions,5;10
106,This is almost the exact opposite of what I am looking for when I travel .,,
107,"I like to read books about my destination before I travel , so that by the time I am there , I already have a rough mental plan of what I would like to see .",rough,25
108,Doing so offers much more flexibility than traveling in a group .,flexibility,5
109,"You can choose exactly where to go and when , regardless of what the majority considers interesting .",,
110,"Some people like to visit churches , others museums or even shopping malls .",,
111,When you travel in a group you almost always have to find a compromise and rarely end up being completely satisfied .,end;up,16;17
112,"My dream vacation includes plenty of time to wander the streets of a new city , without the help of someone who already knows the place .",dream,1
113,"I like to get lost in interesting streets , to try to interact with local people and to see how they walk , shop and talk in their own country .",,
114,"Even when I am not fluent in the local language , I always do my best to use as many words and expressions as possible .",,
115,"I find it much more satisfying , than just using English or Italian , my mother tongue .",,
116,"Based on my experience , I also believe that people react much better when they see that you are traveling on your own and that you respect their culture and try to blend in , instead of being in a large group , looking at them through the reassuring cultural lens of a guide , as if they were exotic animals in a zoo .",respect;blend;in;lens;exotic;animals;in;a;zoo,26;32;33;50;59;60;61;62;63
117,The statment is really general and I disagree with that .,,
118,I think the category of young people should be divided in different groups .,divided,9
119,Surely the first division should be of two big groups : teens and young people from 20 to 26 .,division,3
120,"Teens should go on studying becouse , as we now , their help to their communities will be bigger if they can do some usefull work .",,
121,"But at the same time I think , in that period , a teen must hold a part of the day for his curiosity .",hold,15
122,"People from 20 to 26 , that is the category in which I am , could yet be a worker on could still be a student .",,
123,And I think in both of the situations they are helping their communities .,,
124,"Obviously there could be some exceptions of people that , for different reasons , donotfound their own way .",found;way,16;19
125,But they are exceptions .,,
126,"Than , In Italy , we can decide to give social services to society , also stopping to study for a year , and work in hospitals or old people s houses or something similar .",give,9
127,But I always think the better way to help your communities it is to find your own position as worker inside the system .,find;position;inside;the;system,14;17;20;21;22
128,And to do that young people must do what they do .,,
129,What sould they be supposed to do more ?,,
130,I really would like to understand becouse I read statements like this from when I was child .,,
131,I think that the past world wars did private young people of their youth .,private,8
132,And I think that s not right .,,
133,"So when I realize that I m living in a really beatiful time and in a really comfortable place I think that is a must of mine going on to study , improve my work and enjoy my self .",beatiful;time;comfortable,11;12;17
134,And when I do all of this things I think I m helping my communities .,,
135,I agree with the statement that it is better for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one specific subject .,broad,15
136,"Specialization can be a good thing in life , it helps a person to be good at what he does and be effecient in his work .",,
137,"However , sometimes if a person chooses to take many academic subjects , it gets interesting .",,
138,"Lets say for example , a person takes biology , history and physiology .",,
139,All this knowledge is a great advantage !,,
140,"It leads the person to be more knowledgable , more aware of lots of things and also gives a sense of fun .",leads;gives,1;17
141,Your mind expands and gets different and interesting information each day from different topics .,expands;gets;from,2;4;11
142,Knowledge is a bunch of facts that you accquire from experiences and everyday routines .,accquire,8
143,knowledge on one thing makes life boring especially for a person who is always curious and wants to learn new things .,,
144,"knowledge is unlimited , you have access to it anytime and anywhere .",unlimited;access,2;6
145,I could choose to know everything about one certain topic but that limits my knowledge to that one topic .,limits,12
146,But how about knowing information about different topics ?,,
147,this makes you even more social with different type of people .,,
148,A doctor who knows history gets people astonished .,,
149,They begin to understand the fact that he is good at what he does but also has interest for many other things .,,
150,"In high school , i ve always chosen different electives like music , french and also computer lessons .",,
151,I wanted to know more about each or even be good at them like in my major subject .,,
152,It made me feel wise and able to talk to people about alot of subjects .,,
153,"I could argue and talk in different areas with different types of people , it gives a good impression and also makes my life interesting to learn new stuff and facts everyday .",,
154,That explains why actors now are persuing careers in singing or being leaders of charity acts or organizations .,persuing,6
155,They want to try more .,,
156,It s better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .,broad,6
157,To learn different facts everyday gives color to the mind .,gives;color,5;6
158,"Life is short as they say , so make use of it .",short;make;use,2;8;9
159,"Speacializing in one specific subject , is much more effective than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .",broad,13
160,In the early years there werenotlots of scientists and doctors .,,
161,If i was at that time i would have chosen to have a broad knowledge opposing to have one specific subject to realize in .,broad,13
162,"yet , these days education is improving and there is competion between people .",,
163,"Therefore , i would rather specialized in one area inorder to shine and be known for my uniqeness in this area .",shine,11
164,"In the past years there would be one doctor whom you went to , it didn matter what you were feeling , whether it was a pain in your stomache or or a problem with your eye sight you still went to the doctor .",,
165,"Nowadays , doctors are more an more specialized .",,
166,Even pediatritions are now more specialized where each doctor is concerned about one part of the human body .,,
167,"Furthermore , have a look at teachers .",,
168,in primary school we usually had a class teacher which taught us all subjects .,,
169,"English , Math , Science and the rest of the subjects .",,
170,"yet , when we moved to high school we started realizing that teachers were to a greater sense more specialized , we had a teacher for each subject .",moved,4
171,"Not only that but take Science as an example , not only did we have a teacher for science , but we had a different teacher for Physics , Biology and Chemistry .",,
172,oving on to university we start choosing our major .,oving,0
173,Take buisness for example .,,
174,"You speacilize in major and you find the different smaller topic in buisness , which shows you how specialized it is .",,
175,"What i am trying to prove here , is that this decsion is already made , no one is able to take lots of subjects and not speaclize in one major .",,
176,"You only have the opportunity to choose one major , and sometimes you are able to choose a double major , since some subjects are related to each other , like business and accounting .",,
177,"By speacilizing in one subject , you find it easier to find a job after university , and when you start working its motivating and self - fullfilling to feel that you know your major well , and this makes you like your job and appreciate it .",,
178,"This is why it is very important to choose your major carefully , since this will be the subject you will speacilize in and live with .",,
179,It is possible to change your career but i feel its a shame to waste all these years of studying and start from the beginning,waste;start;beginning,14;21;24
180,"Although some people prefer to travel in a group because of the easiness and safetiness , I would like to travel by myself or with a only few friends .",,
181,Traveling individually is flexible and economical .,flexible,3
182,"In the beginning , I did travel with a group led by a tour guid , because I did not know how to make a plan for a trip , and also I did not speak English enough to travel abroad .",,
183,"In that case , it had better travel in a group and have a tour guide .",,
184,"How ever , I found myself frustrated about waiting the other people to get ready to leave the place we visited and not having any extra time to spend more time at my favorite places .",extra;spend,25;28
185,"On the other hand , if I am traveling by myself , there is no such a problems .",,
186,"I can stay in bed late , or wake up early morning and enjoy the sunrise .",,
187,"Therefore , I can more enjoy the trip without .",,
188,Traveling with a group is usually more costly than traveling individually .,,
189,The tour group usually rent a larger van or bus and reserve the higher grade hotel and restaurants to fullfill the satisfaction of all the guests .,,
190,This may not be needed for some people .,,
191,"If I am traveling by myself , I have time to select hotels and restaurants according my budget .",,
192,"Instead I can spend more money to visit other places or From what I have stated above , traveling individually allows people to easily change and adjust the travel plan instantly as they desire .",,
193,"Moreover , the cost of travel is less than that of traveling in a group .",,
194,The personal travel is the best way and more enjoyable .,,
195,It has been argued that it is better to gain wider knowledge of numerous academic subjects rather than to deeply research one specific subject .,wider;deeply,10;19
196,I disagree with this idea because specializing one particular subject brings several advantages for the following reasons .,,
197,"First , since technology is really advanced nowadays , professional , who have deep knowledge of one subject , are more required than generalists who have broader knowledge .",advanced;deep;broader,6;13;26
198,"For instance , my uncle works in Micro Soft .",,
199,"He told me that when he started working in the company , there were many employees who had vast general knowledges .",vast,18
200,"However , since computer technology has been developed dramatically , the company only hires specialists these days because more sophisticated programmers are essential in order to advance its technology .",advance,26
201,This tendency explains that it is better to focus on a specific subject than to have broad knowledge of wider subjects .,focus;broad;wider,8;16;19
202,"Second , as technology is sophisticated , specialized knowledge is mandatory to protect it as well .",protect,12
203,"For example , PC security and computer hackers are one of good example .",,
204,My uncle has been assigned in a computer security division in Micro Soft .,,
205,"There are 20 core members in his division , who all have PhD , including my uncle .",,
206,Hackers do like computers and they study computer programs very deeply .,deeply,10
207,"Thus , the security division must hire people who are very specialized to fight the hackers .",fight,13
208,This example also represents that it is better to gain a specialized knowledge than broader knowledge of many academic topics .,broader,14
209,"Lastly , specialized knowledge brings higher income .",,
210,"For instance , my uncle receives much higher salary than his long time friend who are a sales representative in Micro Soft .",,
211,His friend studied various subjects in his school age and actually regrets that he should have focused on a particular subject .,focused,16
212,"In summary , although some people insist that it is better to develop broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to focus on a particular subject , I disagree with this idea .",broad;focus,13;21
213,This is because the latest sophisticated technology requires specialists in a particular subject to develop and protect it .,protect,16
214,Specialized knowledge also brings higher incomes .,,
215,Many people are called specialists because they are specialized in one specific subject .,,
216,I think specialists are needed in the society to figure out solutions for many problems .,,
217,"However , I agree with the statement that it is better to hav broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .",broad,13
218,Only a few intelligent people can be specialists .,,
219,Specializing in one certain subject is very hard and requires much concentration on it and intelligence for it .,concentration,11
220,Ordinally people can not compete with such intelligent people who are very into it .,compete;into,4;12
221,"Also , they must be bored to do one thing continuously and forever .",,
222,Intelligent people can do the specialized work and solving problems for others too .,,
223,Knowing wide range of things helps socialize people .,wide,1
224,People can not communicate without common topics .,,
225,Broad knowledge gives people a lot of ideas of topic and enables communicate whoever show up .,Broad;gives,0;2
226,"For example , a couple of people are enjoying talking about English literatures .",,
227,"If one knows some about them , one can get in the conversation as well .",get,9
228,"On the other hand , if one has no idea with them , one can never find a way to communicate with them .",find;a;way,16;17;18
229,Knowledge of many academic subjects gives many choices to people .,gives,5
230,"If a person has knowledge of math , English , and laws , he or she can pick any one of them .",pick,17
231,"If a person specialized in one subject , he or she can not change his or her mind in the middle of the way .",middle;way,20;23
232,It is scary if a person realizes his or her interest is different from what he or she specialized in .,,
233,That is because she or he has no knowledge about anything else .,,
234,He or she needs go back to the very first stage of the other choice .,go;back;to;the;very;first;stage,4;5;6;7;8;9;10
235,"Overall , people need to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because intelligent can specialize one subject for other people , broad knowledge helps to communicate with other people , and people can get change their mind whenever they want .",broad;broad,6;29
236,"Learning has several ways , these ways are developing and improving with time , and with the technology now adays learning ways are changing to be better for the students sake .",,
237,"I agree that it is better for the student to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because when the student understand idea or concept he will never forget it while if he learn it for the sake of the exam , for example , he will forget it faster .",,
238,"I n addition to that , understanding help the student in analyzing different situations , this will help his growing stages of his mind to grow in a healthier way , and he will be unique .",growing;stages;grow;healthier,19;20;25;28
239,"In my personal experience in the college , where i studied in one of the scientific shools , the school of pharmacy , it was more beneficial to do an experiment , see the result , and understand what happened , that was much better than learning it without seeing , and when i was asked about it in the exam i answered with confidence because i saw that and fully understand it before learning it .",,
240,"Now adays , the technology helped a lot the student to search for the information and hence learn it with understanding , the internet for example is on of the most important tools that has helped and still helping many students to search and understand , adding to that the visual media that it offers , because when the human see and hear he will be convinced more and he will not forget it easily .",tools,32
241,"So , according to my experience and my believe , i agree with the statement that understanding is more important than learning , and with the time i think that is the way that most of the educational institutions f",,
242,The pleasure of learning is abig part of the civilization .,,
243,To observe what you experience has everything to do with how you use what you have learned .,,
244,"Understanding concepts and ideas give a big opprtunity for caseation and creative people never consider the importance of facts because if we believe that everyting is a fact there wonothave a space to think and brith with new ideas I believe that what had happend in Art for example its built through different generations who represented different concepts in different society and if we look through the history of art starting from the early civilizations like in caveman work scratching on a stone till Video art , sculpture and computer art .",space;brith;built;look;through,33;37;52;66;67
245,"If we look to artists like Piccasso for example , i believe that what made him a brilliant artist was two things first of all was how he loved trying working with everything and also bing in a society that encourages the new ideas and it pushed him to be what he was .",look;pushed,2;46
246,and that atmosphere of experiments and flying away with new ideas that mainly creats everything new .,atmosphere;flying;away,2;6;7
247,"That what they encourage now in the very high standard art schools all over the world , you take few years leaning how to draw and paint and see muscles but the main pat in there plane to make good artists is to give a big space to think .",take;space,18;46
248,so if you see a great huge sculpture done by the ancient egyptians you have to think about it not to only enjoyed like whey the artist closed this stone color and why he supported the back with arectagler stone that will might lead to a new sculpture of yours using the same stone cold but with an abstract shape,lead,43
249,"I think that learning is an everyday process that is determined by people s attitudes , interests and experiences .",,
250,For this reason i think that a student can increase his knowledge throught different studying methods .,,
251,I think that it is very important for students to have a general knowledge of as many topics and possible .,,
252,"Analyzing general topics presented under the form of concept and ideas , it could be a good way to learn new things without having to study every detail of that particular topic .",,
253,This is the case of subjects related to the humanities .,,
254,It is not necessary to learn to exact year in which a particular theory has been developed .,,
255,"Simply knowing the period and the concept of a particular theory , it can be useful in every field .",,
256,When studying it is necessary to consider the topic analyzed .,,
257,In fact there are many subjects that can be explained by Professors using main ideas and concepts .,,
258,There is no need to go deeper exploring all the causes and effects .,deeper;exploring,6;7
259,In some courses the Professors only requires a general knowledge of a particular topic .,,
260,On the other hand there are subjects where learning facts is essential .,,
261,Some examples can be historic events .,,
262,Learning the facts is determining in order to increase the knowledge on the topic .,,
263,"Scientific disciplines are another example that underlining the importance of learning facts , more that general concept .",underlining,6
264,Think that when a scientist does an experiment he really need to know about facts .,,
265,"To conclude , i think that every subject needs to be treated differently , because i do not think that there is a general rule that determines if it is more important for students to learn from general ideas , than from facts .",,
266,Cars are one of the best inventions that ever been made eventhough it has many advantages and disadvantages like pollution and transporting faster on the other hand but People say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today well i definitely agree with this statment beacuse in twenty years the tecnology will be better that today .,,
267,The tecnology will rise and many other inventions will be made There will be cars but not anymore on dispel or petroleum .,rise,3
268,the cars will work on the battery or there will be a car that is made up from glass that wil trap the sunlight and store them for the car to move .,work;trap,3;21
269,there will also be people that drives airplane or maybe ships ...,,
270,even that now adays we have planes and ships but in twenty years planes and ships will be used as much as people use cars now ...,,
271,"before 20 years or maybe more than that , there was few cars , people used to transport with animals and only a few of them used to have cars , cars were expensive and that what will happen to the generation after twenty years ...",,
272,planes and ships will be less expensive than now .,,
273,also many new kinds of transportation and new ideas will be discovered ...,,
274,people may start living on the moon or on other planets so for sure they will be inventions to drive there or to transport ...,,
275,"Finally times moves fast and no one knows what will happen next but we know that many things are changing , technology is rising and ideas are comming up from many clever persons and i hope that i ll be one of them someday .",moves;fast;rising,2;3;23
276,To invent a new way of transportation that will make it easier and more useful than the cars so everyone will use without causing pollution and be comfortable with .,comfortable,27
277,"When I was younger , I was not good at mathematics .",,
278,Then my parents recommended me to go to a place where I can study for math more .,,
279,"According to the experience in my past , I strong ly agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .",strong,9
280,The reasons why I think so are understanding ideas and concepts helps to memorize easily and it makes me be ready to solve more complicated problems .,,
281,"First of all , I can memorize the elements easier when I can understand ideas and concepts .",elements,8
282,understanding ideas and concepts means what I learn becomes my knowledge .,,
283,"For example , I went to a place to learn math when I was a child .",,
284,Then my instructor taught me how a formula was made .,,
285,Every formula has an original pattern .,,
286,So I just remember several basic formulas and then I can get different formulas by myself with the basic formulas .,basic;get;basic,5;11;18
287,Usually teachers recommend students to memorize every single formula as if they are all facts we have to learn .,,
288,"However , my instructor showed a process how formulas are made .",,
289,The behavior lead me to understand ideas and concepts of formula .,lead,2
290,"Therefore , understanding makes the amount of momerizing .",,
291,"Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts gives me more flexible comprehension when I have a more complicated problem .",gives;flexible,6;9
292,"For example , as math problems , there are different levels of problems .",,
293,"And for tough questions , sometimes I canotsolve tough question with basic ideas .",basic,13
294,"In that situation , it doesnotwork to learn facts because I need more creative and flexible solutions for the tough questions .",flexible,17
295,"At the time , as my instructor did for me , if I understand ideas and concepts of math , it will be much easier to creat new ways as solving the problems .",,
296,"As my conclusion , it is more important and actually more effective for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts because students are required more creative thoughts .",,
297,Facts can not change anything because facts are already complete .,,
298,That s why it is a fact .,,
299,"However , understanding is",,
300,The world has changed drastically since the invention of cars .,,
301,They have made life a lot easier than it used to be .,,
302,"And even though their usage has raised certain environmental concerns , it is my belief that the number of cars used by people will actually increase over the next twenty years .",,
303,"First of all , it is an established fact that the world population is increasing .",,
304,"More and more people are populating the earth , and many of those people will need to buy a car at a certain point in their life .",,
305,"For example , parents who have just had a new baby might in twenty years , or even sooner , make the decision to buy their son or daughter a car if they can afford it .",,
306,"In addition to that , the prices of cars are no longer as high as they used to be ; one can find cars that fit almost anyone s budget .",fit,25
307,"Payment facilitations also play an important role , so that you can buy a car now and pay for it in monthly installments at competitive interest rates .",,
308,And let us not ignore the fact that there are people in the world that have a lot of money to spare and like to follow the latest trends .,follow,25
309,"So they tend to buy the latest Mercedes or BMW models , or even both !",,
310,"To sum up , there are many factors that might lead to an increase in the number of cars available for use by people .",lead,10
311,"Whether they are social factors having to do with the increasing number of people inhabiting this earth , or financial factors that have made it easier for middle class citizens to buy their own cars .",,
312,"But the question remains , what effect will that have on our environment ?",,
313,That should be our main concern .,,
314,I have always enjoyed traveling .,,
315,Every year I have the chance to come to the United States for three months by myself to improve my English language skills I have been doing this for more than five years now !,,
316,I guess I am very lucky ! .,,
317,"Since I have the chance to spend several hours a week at my friend s travel agency I noticed that most of the people prefer being led by a tour guide , I wonder if that is because they are afraid to get lost or not being able to enjoy their vacation at the best or because they are too lazy to organize their vacation by themselves .",spend,6
318,"But it also true that if you want to go on a cultural vacation you do need a tour guide who shows and describes you all the places , the monuments , the history of the place that you are visiting and all those beautiful things that every place in the world has to offer to the tourists .",offer,54
319,Plus if you go to a place where a foreign language is spoken you might not be able to enjoy the vacation because of that .,,
320,"Personally I think that , since I am a free spirit , I love organizing my trips by myself .",free;spirit,9;10
321,"I just like to wake up in the morning when I want to without worrying too much if my trip mates are already downstairs with the tourist guide , ready to go to explore the new places !",,
322,"But I also think that if you decide to go to a place where there is a little danger , having a tourist guide who tells you where you can or canotgo is really important for your safety .",,
323,I think that as long as I will have the chance to travel by myself I will keep doing that .,,
324,Maybe I will change my mind once I get older !,,
325,Who knows ...,,
326,I totally agree with the statement .,,
327,The company that want to advertise their product is making every effort to make it look better .,,
328,They have to make it look better than the product of the other companies to sell more .,,
329,"Otherwise , they will loose customers .",loose,4
330,"I agree with this effert to some point , but there shoud be a limit .",limit,14
331,"They can make it look better , but they should not make it look different , or say something different .",,
332,"For example , a frozen food company can advertise their frozen vegetable during the TV commercial by making look good with some special lightning , but they should not cheat on their vitamin that the vegetable contains .",cheat,29
333,Scientific aspect of the product must be true to the real data .,,
334,"Like this , there is a need for the testing group .",,
335,"Sometimes it is a non profitable organization , sometimes it is government , that do all the research if the company is not cheating in what it says .",cheating,23
336,"After I moved to Germany from Japan , I found an interesting aspect of Gemany .",,
337,There are a lot TV programs and magazines that make test and research to compare products .,,
338,"I have never seen such things in Japan , but I think it gives you a lot of information .",,
339,"It will be useful in a case like when you do not know which hand cream to buy , because all the advertisements make them all look good , the information gives you scientific data that help you to decide .",,
340,"A normal person , who has no scientific background , can never compare the ingredients of hand creams , but the testing programs or magazines do the comparison for you .",,
341,"Like that , you can decide on the product with a scientific base , and at the same time , you know how better the companies are making their product look good .",base,12
342,"Sometimes , the product with an advertisement that did not succeed in making the product look good is better than the others with advertisements that made them look much better than in reality .",,
343,Every community has many type of people .,,
344,"There are the children , yong people and old people .",,
345,each part of those is helping developing their community even if they dont rise that each of them has there way such as young people help there community by getting educated and have a job and forming a family .,part;developing;way;forming,1;6;20;36
346,"getting young people educated is something important for every person , but what does that do to the community ?",,
347,"when person get educated , he becomes more intelligent and more wise so he can do the right thing in the right time and gives him the effort to have a job to help the community to develop , he can graduate as an engineer and build better roads , or a doctor who can help nations to become healthy or a police man who protect the community to be a safer placeagain and so the yong person helped the community .",gives;develop,24;37
348,"Afterwards , these young people will get older and they will get married and they will have children and then they will teach their children how to be good person and help to develop the community and these children will grow up to be more helpful to their community In conclusion , every person is working on develop the community by getting educated and having a good job and forming a family .",develop;develop;forming,33;57;69
349,I disagree about the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people .,,
350,"I think It is true that young people , like students , have much time for going out with their friends .",have,12
351,"But after their graduate school , their life style are going to be changed so suddenly especialy in Tokyo .",,
352,"First of all , They lose their private time .",lose,5
353,"They have to work hard that they have to improve their ability in job to earn more money , for the payment for the apartment fee , having dating , saving future marriage , or having holidays .",,
354,Old people have more money and time than the people in young generation .,have,2
355,That the main reason why I disagreed to the this opinion .,,
356,"First of all , they have a better experience than the younger people .",,
357,"Fine foods , shopping good quality furniture , clothes , go abroad by crossing etc .",,
358,"From my experience , it could be said , I m having more better life in my was than I experienced in my was .",,
359,"I could enjoy eating out at good restaurant , going precious classic concert , buying good quality clothing .",,
360,"Only one thing I can said about negative point about old people is , they donothave enough energy physically sometime .",,
361,"For example , my hobby is used to be skiing , but I feel like start losing enough physical toughness recently , to keep high speed in the big snow slope , keep moving from mountain to contain .",losing,16
362,"I know it is natural changing for everyone , and not only me to face it , but actually it is kind of sad for me .",natural;face,4;14
363,But I m sure about that people could enjoy better life after getting old that the longer generation .,,
364,They know what they want .,,
365,"And more , they could have enough financial confident and much more free time for leisure to enjoy their life style .",have;confident,5;8
366,"In the twentieth century advertising has become increasingly important , and it is one of the keys for the success of a commercial product .",keys,16
367,"Most of the advertisements , though , try to exaggerate the real features of a product , making it seem much better than it really is .",,
368,"Even if of course I canotappreciate this behavior by the advertising companies , I canotblame them because if they would tell just the truth they would have to do huge investments to fill the gap between what they used to advertise and what their product really is or they would lose against their concurrent .",fill;the;gap;lose;against,36;37;38;54;55
369,"This would stress also the workers , as they would probably lose their job or get less money than before .",,
370,"The problem is that the global system is now based upon this assumption , and changing this incorrect behavior would need a global correction of the values of concurrency .",system;based;incorrect;correction,6;9;17;23
371,"But these behavior is well established and so it s due to the consumer to choose the right products , and not to buy the ones made by companies who just invest in advertising without selling good quality products .",,
372,There is nothing we can do besides using our freedom of choice in the best way .,,
373,There is a moment when this behavior by companies and corporations is nearly criminal and they have to be pursued legally .,pursued,19
374,"If a company sells a product that is toxic , unhealthy or if there is a lie in the advertisement , that company has to take its responsability about it in front on a tribunal .",,
375,"For example , I know that sometimes the water that comes from the home sink , that we use and drink every day , is said to be pure in big advertisements around the city .",,
376,"But the laboratory tests have been made in the valley , before the water passes through all the pipes full of rusts in the city .",full,19
377,This is an example of a lie told by the State itself .,,
378,What can a citizen do ?,,
379,"I drink water in bottles , even if I m not sure that my one is etter than the other one .",,
380,"We canotbe sure about anything regarding what s advertised about commercial products , but it s important to keep our eyes open and try to choose the one we think is the best , maybe helping with our buying power those products that claim themselves to be natural and that donotdo too much advertising .",keep;our;eyes;open;power,20;21;22;23;41
381,"When economy grows in a country , more people are able to purchase their own private cars .",grows,2
382,"In this regard , more people may have cars in twenty years in Thailand .",,
383,"As far as Bangkok is concerned , however , I disagree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .",,
384,"Currently , too many cars are on road with less proper regulations and these cars have caused environmental and health problems .",,
385,"Since these problems are geting more serious , the civil society , which may grow more in forthcoming decades in Thailand , urges the Thai Government to restrict the number of cars in Bangkok and the Government has started to take actions as follows .",grow,14
386,"First , the Thai Government has been aware of necessity of more public transportation due to the current trafic situation in Bangkok .",,
387,"In the morning and evening , people commuting by cars including their private vehicles and buses have to spend a lot of time ; this is really wast of time for individuals and the country s development .",spend;wast,18;27
388,"If people can use more varieties of trains with an affordable price and convenient manner , they will of course prefer using them .",,
389,"In this sence , it is important for the Government to continue to develop the underground train and sky-train system not only in Bangkok but also its superb .",,
390,"According to the plan of the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority , I am sure that a lot more lines of these trains will be constructed in twenty years .",,
391,"Second , alike Singapore and other countries , the Government will enforce a proactive regulation for reducing the number of private cars in Bangkok .",,
392,"For example , specific rush hours in morning and evening , a car should have 4 passengers including a driver .",rush,4
393,"Besides , when Bangkok has become more developed , the price of its real estate will increase .",,
394,"Due to it , the parking lots will have to charge much more than now .",,
395,"This has been seen already in a big city like Tokyo , where people avoid using their car for shopping since the parking fee is sometimes more expensive than their purchase at the shopping center .",,
396,"Nowadays , it is common that young people are always away from , responsibility , self management , self motivation and beeing a caretaker .",away,10
397,some people believe that it is a phase for them and after it they will recognize what is the right thing .,phase,7
398,i believe that young people are not helping to thier communities because of many reasons .,,
399,"First , they are not well grown up by their families , it is the parents problem , there was no touch between parents and their children , in another word we can say careless problem .",grown;up;touch,6;7;21
400,the previous situation will deffinetly lead to unsatisfied person who will not care of any thing other than him self .,lead,5
401,"Second , bad friends , it is serious problem , and i experienced this situation , believe me it is a natural thing that young people are always want to know , try and see new things .",,
402,"it is the nature of the human , but this intrest need to be directed in the right way but unfortunately the same can be directed by some people whom not civilized .",directed;way;directed,14;18;25
403,"Third , The free time , fullfilling the time with useful and benificial things like Sports , Studying and working job are important to young people , it builds their feeling of responsibility , enhance their feeling of ownership and improve their personality .",free;fullfilling;builds,3;6;28
404,"In conclusion , if the young people are well raised up , good friend selected for them and spending free in useful and productive works , iam sure that they will be really helpful to their community , but so far every body see that the above are not happenning .",raised;up;spending,9;10;18
405,I agree to the statement where I believe most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .,,
406,Such statement can be supported by my own personal experience and my friend s experience .,supported,4
407,"Through media , such as magazines and televisions , many products are advertised .",,
408,Many of the products seem very cheap and good in quality from the way they are presented .,,
409,"One day , I was watching an advertisement channel where they sold a hair removal spray .",,
410,The advertiser showed how anyone can remove their hair by spraying on their hair and simply wiping it by a towel .,,
411,"The show also showed a person removing her hair through wax very painfully , trying to get across the point this product is better than any other method to remove hair .",,
412,"Strongly convinced by the advertisement , I bought the spray and excitingly waited for its arrival .",Strongly,0
413,"When the product arrived , I tried on the spray immediatly .",,
414,I was dissapointed when the spray did not work at all .,,
415,I kept spraying and wiping but my hairs never came off .,,
416,"From this experience , I realized how advertisements make product seems much better than they really are .",,
417,Another example that supports my opinion is through my friend s experience .,supports,3
418,My friend ordered a cosmetic magazine since she was interested in buying some make-up for herself .,,
419,"When she took a look at the cosmetic magazine , she was surprised at herself for not buying all of her cosmetic through magazine .",,
420,The product were much chapter and seemed better than buying at stores .,,
421,She told me how she was never going to buy cosmetic products at Sephora or other cosmetic stores .,,
422,My friend ordered a pack of lip sticks through the cosmetic magazine and she was busy bragging about it to her other friends .,,
423,"However , when the lip sticks arrived , they were so much smaller than they appeared in the magazine .",,
424,The lip sticks were only about 1 inch long .,,
425,"From then on , my friend learned to never order anything through magazines .",,
426,"From these two experiences described above , it can seen that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .",,
427,We should all be cautious of the advertisements and look into it carefully before buying any products .,look;into;it,9;10;11
428,"I think that this statement is true , but not completely .",,
429,I think it s true that successful people try new things only doing what they already know how to do well .,,
430,"In fact i think that a lot of people who had successful arenotso different from other people , for exemple they have the same intelligence or possibility that a normal person , but they had successful becouse they put all their energy in their work or , generally , in all things that they do .",put;in;in,40;44;51
431,"I can think about a lot of examples who can be industrial men , writers , teachers and opinionists .",,
432,"But without thinking about great man , i can also think about myself experience in my life .",,
433,"All the time that i have done a work in summer , i have seen people who worked very hard having success and improving their situation at work .",,
434,I disagree with the statement becouse i think that s not complete .,,
435,In fact i think that in the history there are a few people who began successfull becouse they were special and quite different from ather people .,,
436,"I can remember for exemplesMarx , who probably was the best thinker in the story , and he created a completely new theory about economy and social problem .",,
437,"I can think about Leonardo da Vinci , Newton and many nobel s prizes and i think that it is not possible that they are similar than me and that there is a little number of man who can do great thing that noone can do .",,
438,I think they are special .,,
439,Concluding i think that there are situations where it isnotimportant how do you work hard and where is more important if you know someone who can help you or who can permit to you having a job or success .,,
440,And it s for that that i have a little fear for my feature in work and in all that i will do .,,
441,Do you think people who always think and act same as other persons do will succeeded in the future ?,,
442,I think people should try new things and take risks for their success .,,
443,I have some reasons to support my opinion .,support,5
444,"First , I think many things are changing rapidly everyday ; for example , people s demands and preferences are different from yesterday .",,
445,Thus we have to think about new things and products .,,
446,"If we donotcare about this point , no one will be interested our business , and we will not succeed .",,
447,"Second , risks produce big success for us .",produce,3
448,Most people do not want to take risks because they are afraid of the result .,,
449,"Then , these people the safety way and get less success .",,
450,They canotget much money or be special people .,,
451,They are just general .,,
452,"However people who take risk will succeed because they chose very difficult way for them , and they will make an effort for success .",,
453,Motivation is totally different among the two people .,,
454,"Finally , people who donottake risks donotbelieve their abilities .",,
455,They canottrust themselves for success .,,
456,We have to believe ourselves for successs .,,
457,"In conclusion , for those reasons I agree with the statement .",,
458,"I think if we want to success , we should try risks and believe our possibilities and future .",,
459,People has different ideas about successful whether it is to creat a new things or to do usual work .,,
460,Doing what we already know how to do well doesnotmake you different and does not make happy comparing with creating new things .,,
461,In my opinion i stongly agree that successful is to create new things and take risks for several reasons .,stongly,4
462,"First of all , it is a great thing to be promenet and different than others .",promenet,11
463,"For example , if some body creates a treatment for Danser and another one does his regular work who is succeeded ? .",,
464,Ofcourse the first one because he creates new things which helps sick people .,,
465,So this person must be famous and every body wont to work with them .,,
466,"In addition , you can tase the real successful if you took risks and adventures .",tase,5
467,Person has to love his work to creat new thing and to be succeeded indeed .,,
468,By taking risks you learn new useful things that helps you in your life .,,
469,My brother was in running race and he not only won but also created a new record number .,,
470,He was very happy to take rises and score new number .,,
471,"Last but not least , trying new things helps you to get more experience and self-confidence .",,
472,By doing this new things you well be proved and every body loves you .,,
473,"In conclusion , i wiil be a dentist and i will create new things for my world because that s the real successful .",,
474,I hate to do my regular work without trying to do new things .,,
475,I ultimately agree with the fact that it is better to be specialized on a specific subject than to spread energy on different subjects .,spread,19
476,"However I say ultimately , because being and staying focused on one subject means always to discard other subjects .",focused;discard,9;16
477,I found the focus necessary and very important at a certain late stage of the personal working career or academic career .,focus;late;stage,3;11;12
478,The reason behind his you build up some Spikes of knowledge on a broad knowledge platform .,build;up;Spikes;on;broad;platform,5;6;8;11;13;15
479,These sharp spikes of knowledge will allow you to promote yourself and to pull with you the society forward .,sharp;spikes;pull;forward,1;2;13;18
480,Having said that a deep knowledge of one subject can only be based on the focus on a certain subject and none us are born with a direction and with a goal ready to be accomplished from the day of birth .,deep;focus;direction,4;15;27
481,Instead we should find our path and our focus by ourself and to do that we need a broad range of knowledge .,path;focus;broad,5;8;18
482,"Think for example to the manager of a company who is very good financially , but it present know history , politics ...",,
483,"He will always take the best financial decision and at the same time will always have a strong opposition inside his team or industry , because as he doesnotknow the history and the culture of the people behind the business , he will never be able to respect them .",strong;behind,17;39
484,"Therefore I think in an early stage it is positive to broad our knowledge on different subjects like : history , languages , politics , arts , mathematics , Physics , biology , economy ...",early;stage;broad,5;6;11
485,However at a middle or later stage we should focus or refocus on the subjects we love more or on the subjects which will give us more satisfactions .,middle;or;later;stage;focus;refocus,3;4;5;6;9;11
486,As an example for this I can talk about myself .,,
487,"I have received an education on differents topics from latin to mathematics , I have study engineering and I got a doctorate degree in engineering , however one day I found out that my life was in business , therefore after twelve years working in sales marketing , I decide to build up my knowledge focused on business matters and to pursue an MBA study and I am sure that this will bring success to myself and to the people around me .",build;up;focused;pursue,51;52;55;61
488,How successful are you ?,,
489,Have you ever felt that you are successful enough that you donotneed to try other things and become successful in other things you did not try before .,,
490,"Well , you are not really a successful if you think what you succeeded in is enough .",,
491,Successful people are those who worked hard to accomplish and achieve their goals .,,
492,"As a matter of fact , you wonotbecome successful unless you work hard for what you want to achieve .",,
493,You can become successful if you really worked hard for what you want .,,
494,"Successful people tend to try new things other than the ones they already succeeded in , because as successful , they truly believe that they have to keep working hard to achieve more goals and have various careers where they succeeded in , even if they had to pay their own risk on the trials of becoming successful in more careers .",pay;trials,48;54
495,"Successful s ambitions do not stop at a particular point , they always have ambitions and they always want to achieve more no matter how much risk this will cause them .",stop;point,5;9
496,"They believe that to success , you have to try , risk and work hard , and they work based on that theory .",based;theory,19;22
497,"Moreoever , if successful people tried new things and they failed , they wouldnotbe discouraged and they would try the same thing again and again , until they succeed .",,
498,It is a matter of challange .,challange,5
499,"Successful people always like to take challanges and achieve their goals in any case , and they do not accept failure .",challanges,6
500,"They might fail , but they wonotlose hope .",lose,8
501,"They keep their hopes as high as they were and try again on the same thing , until they success and become successful in another thing .",high,5
502,"All in all , I personally think that since successful people are optimistic , hard working , smart , and like challenging , they will always want to try new things and take risks rather than just convincing themselves that what they have succeeded in is enough .",challenging,21
503,"They would do more things than what they already know how to do well , and I believe that they will success one time even if they failed several times .",,
504,"In my opinion , I disagree with the idea in the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .",,
505,I d like to give several reasons below .,,
506,Here is the list of reasons why I think so .,,
507,One specific reason that comes readily to mind is that I am able to not only go anywhere with whomever I want to but also change the schedule of travel flexiblly by myself if I go to travel individually .,comes;flexiblly,4;30
508,"In traveling to somewhere , I d rather want to go not only very popular place but also such a place where it is not so famous .",,
509,"For example , it happened when I went to germany with my family by not a tour .",,
510,"After traveling several days in Germany , I went to a small church with my father in early morning .",,
511,"Of course I also visit very famous place , for example the church of Kelln , but at that time , I was so impressed by the beauty of that small church .",,
512,It is one of the greatest experience for me during my stay in Germany .,,
513,"Like this , Of course visiting famous place by a tour group is good , but I want to go to a place which is not presented by a tour guide .",,
514,I think that tour group tend to visit only popular place .,,
515,"Secondly , I can be excited by planning a tour itself .",,
516,"When I travel to somewhere , I always take long hours for planning and organizing the schedule of trip .",take,8
517,"I d like to consider how I will go round , where I will go and so on .",,
518,I can learn the geographic condition of a place or the weather pattern of a place by planning by myself .,,
519,It s preferable for me .,,
520,Planning travel is very exciting activity .,,
521,"If I went to a trip by a tour group , I would not be able to plan on any schedule because a tour guide must make overall plan .",,
522,"Of course , I canotdeny that there should exist some advantages in traveling by a tour group .",,
523,"If we travel by a tour group , we can receive detail explanation about some historical heritage or cultural things .",,
524,And we may go a place where we canotfind by ourself because a tour guide is a proffesional and he or she must knows well about sightseeing spot than us .,spot,29
525,This idea may make an equally valid argument for the opposite position .,,
526,"But on careful consideration , I strongly believe that advantages brought by traveling individually must exceed those by traveling by a tour group .",strongly;brought,6;10
527,"Considering all of the above factors , of course there are some advantages in traveling by a tour group , I find more advantages in making a trip individually .",,
528,"Actually , I tend to change my schedule many times during my trip inherently , I think my nature doesnotfit the trip by a tour group .",nature;fit,18;21
529,Trip that I can change the schedule flexiblly is far more fascinating for me .,flexiblly;far,7;9
530,I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .,,
531,"Because success is usually associated with new things and risk-taking , although some successful possibility is in what s already been know to do .",,
532,"If you want to succeed , you have to get attention and attract people , and you have to get out of the old and current tendencies .",get;attract;get;out;of,9;12;19;20;21
533,"First of all , trying new things might be risky to succeed ; however .",,
534,"when you think of big business , you have to be imaginative and creative about what will be the next trend in the society and what people need .",,
535,"People always want to try new things and keep the good things about new ; therefore , doing something what have already known or done will not change your life drastically .",,
536,You do not want to repeat the same things that someone have done before .,,
537,That is not the demand of people .,,
538,"They need something new , exciting , and amusing .",,
539,"If you want to succeed , you need to try new things .",,
540,"In addition to the new things , you take risks if you want to succeed because taking risks will be always along with trying new things .",,
541,"Although you are not sure if this will be accepted among people or not , as long as you are in the secured fields which have already known or done , you will never get a chance to succeed , or you will have less oppotunities to succeed .",secured;fields,22;23
542,"Taking risks sometimes might cause a big damage , but it might give you a huge success in your life .",big;damage;huge,6;7;15
543,"Therefore , trying new things and taking risks are always together , and they are something people have to follow if they want to be successful .",follow,19
544,"All in all , there are so many successful people who try new things and take risks , and it is important for people who want to succeed to t",,
545,"The foremost business philosopher in America Jim Rohn said , To survive in the twentieth century you have to know more than one skill .",survive,11
546,"Today , life is changing at a very high pace and more than ever before .",pace,9
547,The computer age which revolutianized every possible aspect in the world has gotten us to what we call the age of knowledge where to specialize in one specific subject is not enough in order to fulfill one s self .,age;aspect;age;fulfill,2;7;19;35
548,Therefore it is better and imperative that one gets specialized in more than one domain for economic reasons and personal reasons .,,
549,Everyone wants to lead comfortable lives and have a safe future .,safe,9
550,Most of us want to be rich .,,
551,"To do so , nobody is going to be specialized in only one field because now , and more than ever , all fields are related to another .",,
552,"For instance , let s take real estate .",,
553,"An investor who wants to invest in real estate has to have an education in business , law , finance , banking , and even construction .",,
554,"If this investor is only familiar in business , how can he know about taxation policies , or about which kind of construction material to choose from ?",,
555,"Therefore , a knowledge in more than one subject can prove a valuable asset when it comes to increasing wealth .",asset,13
556,To seek knowledge is everyone s personal ambition .,seek,1
557,The process is tough and lifelong .,,
558,It requires a thirst for learning and a hunger to seek the many truths which our world stores .,thirst;hunger;seek;stores,3;8;10;17
559,To have knowledge in a lot of subjects is a virtue in society .,virtue,10
560,It gives reputation and instant recognition .,,
561,"Take a company that wants to hire a new employee and that has the possibility of choosing two candidates : a person having a business degree who has worked only in one kind of firm all his life , and another holding the same degree who has worked in many different trends of business .",,
562,The company should choose the latter since he s been exposed to the world more than the other candidate .,exposed;to;the;world,10;11;12;13
563,"Also , having an idea of a lot of subjects can be self satisfying since no one can laugh at the person or try to trick him .",,
564,The world is filled with cons and crook men .,filled,3
565,"If you re limited to only one type of education , the chances of you being cheated are very high .",limited,3
566,Therefore having a broad knowledge in many domains can be rewarding on a personal basis .,broad,3
567,"To sum up , being involved in more than one subject is much better than being only involved in one for many reasons such as economic reasons and personal reasons .",,
568,Today the world obliges us to invest our time in education since it will affect our living conditions .,obliges;invest,3;6
569,Being more knowledgeable is also rewarding in that it gives a good image and reputation and can serve as a defence against cheating .,gives;serve;defence,9;17;20
570,"And the most important thing is to keep learning , keep living , loving , and leaving a legacy for others to follow .",leaving;legacy;follow,16;18;22
571,"It seems to me that young people spend time on something they enjoy at the moment , but that does not mean that young people enjoy life mroe than older people .",spend;on,7;9
572,"In my opinion , older people enjoy their life more than young people do .",,
573,"My father , who is 57 year old and have life time job , seems enjoying the life more than my younger brother , who is 15 year old and still attending school .",,
574,There are some reasons why I think that way .,,
575,"My younger brother goes to school everyday , yet he still have more time to spend on whatever he wants to do .",have;more;spend,11;12;15
576,Is he enjoying his life ?,,
577,The answer is no .,,
578,He is often worried about the future and all the problems he has to face in order to succeed in the future .,face,14
579,"He still has no idea what he would become later in life , and there are many concerns to achieve what he wants to be .",become,8
580,"On the other hand , my father works at the company and he is busy all the time .",,
581,It seems that he has no spare time to spend but he is enjoying the life very much .,has;spare;spend,4;6;9
582,He is more experienced than my younger brother and have more knowledge .,have,9
583,"When it comes to the question of whether person is enjoying the life or not , I believe it is a lot to do with their experience .",,
584,"When you are older and more experienced , handling problem would be easier than when you have to face one in young age .",handling;face,8;18
585,"Since for my father , his life goal as to get the job that he wants and have family is already achieved , he has no concern about his future .",goal,7
586,Therefore he can enjoy life much better than my younger brother because he has no concern about life that it makes the life more enjoyable .,,
587,"In conclusion , the case of family is not always true for every old people and young people .",,
588,Some people are able to achieve their goal when they are still young and perhaps such young people enjoy life more than some old people who is still struggling to achieve the goal .,goal;struggling;goal,7;28;32
589,"Despite those cases , I believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do .",,
590,"Every idea and concept in the world is based on fact and it canotbecome only if there is fact that relate to it , there is a connector between them , so disagree with the statment which says that it is more important reason for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .",based;become;connector,8;15;29
591,"First , any idea or concept should be supported to be more convincable and people can understand , so there should be at least one kind fact that happen or that known to make that idea or that concept is realistic and strong that can people understand .",supported;strong,8;42
592,"Second , many idea that donothave facts disappear with the time because they donothave any thing that they are based on it , so most people ignore them and they become useless idea until one of the people approved it by a fact or some thing like that .",disappear;based;useless,9;23;35
593,"Third , most of people use facts in the writing or research because it make their writing or research more strong and show people that who wrote this article or did this reasearch knows what he is talking about and the writing or the reasearch would be rich of right instead of hypothesis .",strong;talking;rich,20;37;47
594,"Fourth , many scientists who has won prize of approving that there research are right , their reasearhs were basesd on facts that made their research more convince and understand for all the world and their ideas become on of the importants laws .",basesd,19
595,"In conclusion , facts are very improtant for students becase they are the base of the ideas and concepts by suppoting them to make them convertible , make the articles very rich of right information that helps people , and it can approved our idea and become a law instead of an useless idea .",base;suppoting;rich;useless,13;20;31;52
596,I disagree with the following statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as following reasons .,,
597,"First , Instead of cars , nothing will be improved and developed in twenty years .",,
598,I can not find any special reason which there will be fewer car in use than there are today .,,
599,"In addition to cars , we use trains , planes and ship everywhere , however , cars are the most useful and convenient for people .",,
600,"For example , it is very easy to go from the house to the destination for children and disabled people especially .",,
601,They do not need to walk to the station and airports .,,
602,"Second , there will be fewer population in twenty years .",,
603,People have their own cars .,,
604,"If the population decrease drastically , the amount of the cars will decrease .",,
605,"However , it is said that Chinese and Indian population will increase drastically .",,
606,It means they will have the chance to get their own cars in twenty years .,,
607,"For example , in Japan it will have the chance to increase many cars due to traffic circumstances .",,
608,It is said that there will be 25 of old people living .,,
609,I think they can not continue to use Japanese railway and subway .,,
610,There are a lot of problems for them .,,
611,"First , there are not elevators at the stations .",,
612,It is impossible to use the station forever even if they are healthy .,,
613,"Second , there is a rush hour , commuting time every day .",rush,5
614,It start at 9 oclock and finish at 5 oclock at Japanese companies .,,
615,"Even if you are young student and office workers , it is difficult to adjust to the circumstances .",adjust,14
616,"In conclusion , I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .",,
617,In twenty years from now there would be nothing but cars everywhere and i definitly dont think there would be any way to pretend that there will be fewer .,,
618,"People need cars and vehicles all the time , they need to go to work , they need to pick they kids from school , they need to buy a second as a birthday gift for their wives , they need to race , they need to brag about new generations of expensive cars , so that means that nowadays , cars are as much important as water and food and as the population of the world is increasing , we going to need more cars because there will be more people .",pick,19
619,"But lets get real practical about it , why there would never be fewer in 20 twenty years ?",,
620,"The answer is easy , but the consequence is going to be really devastating .",devastating,13
621,"Lets see , we have a rich family that owns more than two cars , and as many kids they are having it is new car coming with it , not because they really need it , but just for the flexure of it , the bragging and boating that comes among they social classes when they start talking about how many cars they have and what kind of cars it is .",,
622,That is just for one .,,
623,"On the Second , there is the economical cars generations , that is the main reason would be nothing but more and more cars every single year m if not saying every single day .",,
624,"These kind of cars are not really expensive , better yet , they are not expensive at all , that is what allows everyone , middle class , upper class , some poor folks to get a car for a cheap amount of money and with all the help that the banks give people to buy anything , we are going to see more cars in the upcoming twenty years , and i bet that is willing to reach a number that would even go beyond the human being population over earth because if we just try and analyze it , we are going to find out that every single man has more than one car and that is actually ruining everything , ruining the cities , ruining the environment , ruin the economy of some countries and most of all ruining the world and the nature .",willing;reach;go;beyond;ruining;ruining;ruining;ruin;ruining,76;78;84;85;120;123;127;131;141
625,Nowadays the advertisements are very important for a product in commerce .,,
626,Advertisements make the product be known and they have to help the product to be sell .,,
627,So factories and societies that product something try to present their product the best they can .,,
628,So that an advertisement make a product seem much better than it really is often happens .,,
629,"For example , I love going to the cinema and obviously to do that I have to know what is on in the day I want to go ; I must have an idea of which film I m going to watch .",,
630,"There are many advertisements on tv , for example , that describe these films , and these advertisements are called trailers .",,
631,"In this case the most of the time the films whose trailers I watched seem wonderful and I often decide to go and see them ; but when I am in the cinema I understand that the trailer , during its sixty seconds , presents to me a collage of the best scenes of the film , but the other dozens of scenes are bad !",collage,48
632,In this way and in this case an advertisement make a product seem much better than it really is .,,
633,And this can happen also with foods or drinks .,,
634,"So I essentially agree with the statement , but also I think that after some time , after the product was known by the population , people start to speak each other about it and each other they clarify all the aspects , positive and negative , of the product .",,
635,After that there is an evolution in watching or listening advertisements ; after that people recognized the typical ways societies use to make a product seem better than it really is .,evolution,5
636,"In this way , now I am partially able , for example , to understand watching their trailer if films are bad of course or if I can try and see them .",,
637,"In conclusion , I agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are , but I think that sometimes people are able to understand that .",,
638,I think that most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .,,
639,"They do make lots of goods more appealing , and colorful or handy .",appealing;handy,7;12
640,The truth reveals when you buy it and us it .,reveals,2
641,"Although advertisement is important to a new products in the market , to show people a new line of food , computers or services .",line,17
642,It does not require to run the advertisement too many times a day .,run,5
643,"I think that any good reliable goods and services will eventualy control the market , regardless of how many times other products would run their advertisements because they will fail in the selling process as long as they are not as good .",control;run,11;23
644,"When I want to buy a computer , for example , I think first of Dell , although there are lots of other popular brands which they have lots of advertisements that run several times on several TV canals and even on the newspapers .",run,32
645,I still like Dells computer .,,
646,I guess leaning from personal experiance is way more valiable than all the nice things you see and hear about a products in an advertisements .,valiable,9
647,Another example of service .,,
648,"When it comes to a TV cable I like Direct TV , .",,
649,This also because of a personal experiance .,,
650,The service that I had before was not reliable and nothing even close to what they advertise .,close,12
651,You could never talk to a person when you call them after having a problem .,,
652,Which happened to occur too many times .,,
653,Like losing the signal .,losing,1
654,Aside from that .,,
655,I had always wondered how much these people producers are making to be able to afford these expensive advertisements .,,
656,Because this tells me that the products would really be much cheaper if they have not wasted lots of money on these advertisements .,wasted,16
657,"Although the role of advertisements is very important , it mostly has been over used .",over;used,13;14
658,"for example , in the city where I live I keep seeing this advertisement on TV that talks about how wonderful this chain of resturants are .",chain,22
659,"The funny part is , this chain of resturants is not existed in the state where I live .",chain,6
660,"Total wast of money , unless they expect from me to travel to other state to have a dinner .",wast,1
661,I agree with that statement because learning facts are based on understanding ideas .,based,9
662,Students can not learn new facts without knowing where they came from or what corroborate them .,came;from,10;11
663,"for some people , memorizing a new fact is enough .",,
664,It might not be that important to them to understand it or study it .,,
665,but i disagree with that .,,
666,there has to be a base for everything someone learns or it wont be considered learning .,base,5
667,"My favorite subject has always been Math because , unlike subjects like History and Literature , its all based on logic .",based,18
668,everything has an explanation and acknowledging that explanation leads to acknowledging a new fact .,leads,8
669,"When students understand ideas , they become more productive , and more accomplished , because grasping and analyzing ideas leads to creative which leads to creation .",grasping;leads;leads,15;19;23
670,"Students have differents learning skills , some learn by memorizing conclusions , and some cant memorize without an knowing how they reached to the those conclusions .",reached,21
671,"Understanding ideas is more difficult that learning facts . a fact can be learned by reading a book or a biography , an idea has to be studied to be learned , which obliges more thinking .",,
672,"As a result , one who studies new concepts provide more in the community in the future , because what is his or her mind are not just fixed facts , they are ways of thinking .",fixed;ways,28;33
673,"If someone thinks about the technology that is enhancing everyday and the growth of our economies , it will be clear that it is the cause of knowledge , knowledge that is not only obtained by memorizing facts but by creative minds .",obtained,34
674,There is more to improvement than learning facts .,,
675,and when i say improvement i mean in yourself .,,
676,when you want to improve youself you need to understand what you learn to implicate it .,,
677,Thats how the process of teaching works as well .,,
678,Teachers could have just given out books and told students to read them at home and get tested on them the next day .,,
679,Wouldnt that have been easier if the point wasnotto make students understand what they re taking in school ?,taking,17
680,"It is not easy to say which is the better approach , but I personally do not agree with the statement , because I think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject .",approach;broad,10;27
681,I say this for two main reasons .,,
682,The first reason is that it is more practical for students .,,
683,"I mean , if you can concentrate on one subject it will be easier for you to learn lots of things on that subject and you will be able to become prepared .",concentrate,6
684,But when I say more practical I refer also to the fact that studing one subject instead of more than one is good for the student s path .,path,27
685,"I mean , once a student has entered the subject he should know what that subject requires , what the important aspects are and he would be able to organise his studies in the best way .",entered;aspects,7;21
686,maintaining your mind open to a lot of subjects is a big effort .,maintaining;open,0;3
687,"It is true that keep your mind open could be a good thing , giving you a wide range of knowledge , but the question is if this knowledge will be useful in your future .",keep;open;giving;wide,4;7;14;17
688,This question brings me to expose the second reason that supports my opinion .,,
689,I argue that specialising will be useful for working .,,
690,"Companies , or institutions , usually do not hire people who have a general approach , that know a lot of things , but that remain on the surface of them .",approach;surface,14;28
691,"Companies require people to be expert in something and to become an expert you have to get into things , to discover all the aspects , to prevent all the problems .",in;get;into;discover;aspects,6;16;17;21;24
692,As for my personal experience I have to say that I m in a class with a very general approach and I think it is not good .,approach,19
693,"I m glad that I ve got a solid basic cultural background , but I am sincerely worried about my future .",solid,8
694,You could ask me why I am in such a class and the answer would be that I do not know .,,
695,"When I chose my class I thought it was more specialist , but I was wrong , but I think to be lucky as well because I had the opportunity to attend lots of intersting courses and to meet lots of good professors .",,
696,I disagree with the statement .,,
697,"Traveling in a group takes away your freedom in time and space You may find it is easier and safer to move around in a group , but in reality , if you wish to go and stay in a certain place for a certain time , that choice is not possible if the group has a different agenda .",takes;away,4;5
698,"A tour guide can be useful and informative , but this also takes your agency of deciding what to see , where to go .",takes,12
699,"The best part of traveling in a group with a tour guide is the safety and the less effort you need to gather information about the place , and information for ensuring the safety .",gather,22
700,"But this is also the worst part of traveling in a group , in that , it eliminates positive accidents .",eliminates,17
701,"By positive accidents , I mean your opprotunity to meet people , find a great shop or street by accident , find a new things about the place which may not be marketed in the mainstream tourism .",mainstream,35
702,"Traveling in a group can take away some occurences that can only happen because you have no agenda or specific information , because you wonder around .",take;away,5;6
703,A good example of this is going to a restaurant .,,
704,"If you travel to Hong Kong , you find there are restaurants that are specifically for tourists .",,
705,"They are expensive , give less information about local food and culture , and you meet no locals .",give,4
706,"But if you are willing to take a risk of wondering around , asking around the local people to show a good restaurant , that experience can give you so many episodes .",give;episodes,27;31
707,"You get to communicate with the local people , maybe try speaking a foreign language , find out what is considered a good food in the place and how to use the public transportation , and line up in the restaurant and eat , learning the local way of doing things .",,
708,"Since I prefer adventure and really experiencing a place when I travel , instead of being a part of marketted and selling out tourism , I choose to travel alone , in my way , in my own timing .",selling;out,21;22
709,"If I work hard to find a good restaurant , I would like to decide what to eat there and how long to stay , not minding what the group may and should do .",,
710,"Some may say the trouble it takes to gather information about the place on higher own is too much , and it is better to leave the job to the tour guide .",gather,8
711,"However , recently there are so many books and websites about traveling alone or as a couple but without any guide that are easily accessble , that the things I mentioned above about getting around on your won can be easily found in a book , such as Lonely Planet .",accessble,24
712,"After all , traveling is a means to get away and placing yourself in an odd situation , getting away from your mundane life and chores .",,
713,"In that perspective , no group tour is beneficial if that limits your adventure - possitive accidents .",,
714,"By planning and traveling alone , you may find a new aspect of the place you are visiting , which is your own original version and not the marketted version that are equally given to any tourists .",original;version;version,23;24;29
715,"I think my position can be easily supported by the numerous current TV programs about backpaking , traveling alone , seeking so-called adventure in traveling .",supported,7
716,A famous example of this will be a program called global trekkers .,,
717,Now the trend is in adventure .,,
718,"Traveling in a group with a tour guide may be a good idea for older people , but for myself , I chose traveling alone .",,
719,"When I was living in the United States , there was a short period of time , about a week or so , when I didnothave a car .",,
720,"To go to a supermarket , I had to walk for an hour , and imagine how bad it was to come home with four fig-plastic bags in both hands .",,
721,I definitely needed a car in order to survive there .,survive,8
722,"Considering that cars are currently one of the major transportation tools among people in developed countries , I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today because twenty years is just not enough time .",tools,10
723,To replace the existence of cars with other means of transportation would take more than twenty years to accomplish .,take,12
724,"It is said that the gas emitted by cars has a tremendously bad effect on the environment , a problem called global warming , and that countries are working to decrease the number of cars in use .",,
725,"However , in order to accomplish this goal , there needs to be other ways people can transport , such as trains and metro .",,
726,It would be hard for any city governments to come up with a plan and to put that into action in twenty years .,,
727,Another thing that would be hard to change in twenty years is people s habits .,,
728,"When you have been using a car , for example , to drive to school everyday , you will find it hard to change the way you commute to other means , such as the train .",,
729,"It is hard for someone to make a change in their lifestyles , and he or she would need a definite reason for doing so .",,
730,"If the city made a law prohibiting the use of a car , this would sure drive the person to quit driving the car , but making that law in use would take more than twenty years .",drive,16
731,Passing a law requires a lot of time .,,
732,Imagine the voices that would come about from the people when a plan to make this law arises .,voices,2
733,"Even if it doesnottake a law to try to change people s awareness , I can not come up with another option .",,
734,"For the reasons I mentioned above , I believe it is impossible to decrease the number of cars in use than there are today in twenty years .",,
735,"To do so , there needs to be other ways people can tranport , which they could feel comfortable and convenient as cars .",,
736,"Of course , there are places around the world , for example Tokyo , where subways have been well developed and people donotneed cars to get around .",,
737,"However , from the experience I had in the United States , I would have to say that people there wouldnotlike that .",,
738,A key to answer to this question is to think about the different purposes of study .,,
739,"Certainly , a specialization in a specific academic topic is essential to do any research .",,
740,"First because the specialization brings to a more deep knowledge , and then to a better comprehension .",deep,8
741,"Besides , if you want to say any orginal thing concerning a subject , you will have to know almost all has already been done or written .",,
742,"In this sense , a focussed study is fundamental .",focussed,5
743,"On the other hand , if you want to reasearch , a broad knowledge is surely useful .",broad,12
744,"Your mind will be more open , and outside of your topic you will find different approach to problems that can help you .",open;outside;find,5;8;14
745,You will may also bring ideas from other fields to your specific one .,bring;from;fields,4;6;8
746,"You will be able to use the analogy to resolve you problems , that is a very powerful method .",powerful,17
747,"From these observations , is surely better not to specialize .",,
748,"If the purpose of the study is merely to stay in the world with more instruments , a person that has studied many different topics will be more cultured .",instruments,15
749,So he or she will be in a better position than anyone that hasnotstudied or that has studied only one thing .,,
750,It will also be more difficult to betray him or her .,,
751,"Whatever are your purposes , if you donotstop studying , you will be always curious , and your brain will always be active .",active,24
752,"Concerning this , there two other reasons that support the idea of not to restrict the fields of interest .",restrict;fields,14;16
753,"Once you have read all has been written on you topic , will you be able to start studying a different subject , or , on the contrary , you wonot?",,
754,"It is known that any different topic involves a different part of brain ; it is vital for the development of the whole brain not to specialize , but to learn about very different subjects , like music , literature , sciences .",part;whole,10;22
755,"On conclusion , is better not to spend all you efforts on only one topic , but to study how much subjects as you can .",spend,7
756,"It will help you in your work , in your life , and will keep safe longer your brain .",keep;safe,14;15
757,I partially agree with the statement .,,
758,I consider it true for a certain kind of products and false for other kind of products .,,
759,"I will explain my opinion by going through the purpose of advertisement , how it works and some practical examples of how it could actually improve a product or just how it could only make it seem better .",going,6
760,The purpose of advertisement is to express one or more ideas related to the product that is advertised in order to increase the appreciation of the product and therefore to convince to buy it or eventually just to agree with the message the advertisement wants to communicate .,message,41
761,"The final image that the advertisement gives about the subject could be true or false , bad or good , but anyway if the product is ment to be just a carrier of that image or cluster of ideas associated , the advertisement is functional to the improvement of the product .",image;carrier;image,2;31;34
762,Examples of a product meant to carry an idea are generally status symbols or fashion products .,carry,6
763,"Typically a purse or a very expensive watch have basic functions regarding their original purpose , but these objects are mostly considered for what they look like and the sensation they give due to esthetic values that determine the quality of an image : in fact , they could even not be functional but still used !",image,42
764,The advertisement increases or eventually refines the ideas associated with the object so that the messages advertised are totally functional with the product .,increases;refines;messages,2;5;15
765,Another example for these kind of products are all types of sportswares to which the advertisement gives the impression that by using it the performance would increase .,,
766,Self suggestion in this case actually would increase the performance due to the image carried by the product .,image;carried,13;14
767,"Examples of advertisments that make products seem much better than they really are , are those products that do not carry image importance , but that just need to be functional .",carry;image,20;21
768,A simple example could be a set of knives that the advertisement shows to be very handy and that cut very well but only beacuse in the demonstration only cooked vegetables were cut .,handy,16
769,Another example could be a tool box set that looks great and shiny but is made of cheap materials that deform easily upon medium mechanical stress .,shiny;cheap,12;17
770,"A lecture may be a useful , but boring way to teach a person about a country or a city .",,
771,"Travelling , on the other hand , is a very unique way to learn because people gain the knowledge while having fun .",gain,16
772,"Not only does it teach about a historical aspect or a specific condition in the country or city , but it also gives the people the opportunity to live within what they are learning , and to actually be able to see , feel and even touch what they are learning about .",teach;gives,4;22
773,"A person , however , can not learn just by seeing or being in the place ; the best way to get the most out of the travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .",get;the;most;out;of,21;22;23;24;25
774,"A tour guide is an expert who will give all the interesting historical , technological and even social facts and beauties of the place a person visits .",give,8
775,It is more fun if you listen to a person talking than just reading a book or asking people .,,
776,A tour guide will show you places you may not be able to reach or know about by yourself .,,
777,"Also , if you have any questions about anything in a trip , the tour guide is a person who is already there to help you .",,
778,"Travelling with a tour guide and a group is much safer than traveling alone , especially if it is a place not familiar or is not being visited before by the traveller .",familiar,22
779,There is a lesser chance for a person to get lost in a new place if the person was with a group led by a tour guide .,,
780,"The place may also be dangerous , such as theft or kidnapping .",,
781,"When you are with a group and a tour guide , it is less likely for you to be kidnapped or rubbed .",,
782,"And so , traveling alone may be fun , but the consequences of it can be dangerous or less useful for the individual .",,
783,"However , traveling with a group and a tour guide is both a fun means and an affective way of gaining knowledge .",gaining,20
784,I really do not agree that young people enjoy life more than the older do .,,
785,I think they enjoy different areas of life but with the same intensity .,areas;intensity,5;12
786,It looks like that young people are having fun with a lot of physical activities because at that stage of their life the body is always full of energy and rich of sensations .,stage;full;rich,18;26;30
787,"On the other side I see a lot of old people prefer mental activities such as reading , meditation and conversation .",,
788,This happens just because at their stage of life they learn and take advantage of their mental skills .,stage;advantage,6;13
789,"For exemple , you can see in the same park a group of kids having a blast during a soccer game , and their grandparents sitting on a bench and be completly immerse in a conversation or reading a book .",blast;immerse,16;32
790,Even with music we have two different worlds : young generation enjoy fast and laud music that they dance till they drop on the floor .,worlds;drop;on;the;floor,7;21;22;23;24
791,Adults get excited with less hectic music that they can listen and dance as well .,hectic,5
792,"But , if you go to a dance studio , you can see that regardless the age and the kind of music people is dancing , everybody is enjoying that activity .",,
793,The intencity they put in what they are doing and the reward they get from what they are doing is not related to their age .,intencity;put;in;reward;get;from,1;3;4;11;13;14
794,They just get from different sources of joy Sources that are more fitting with their physical and mental status of the age they have .,get;from;sources;Sources;fitting,2;3;5;8;12
795,"My impression is that both , young and old people get a lot of joy from the activites that they choose .",get,10
796,"Like I said at the begining , they choose very different ways to spend their time but the intencity and pleasure level they achive , I am sure is the same .",spend;intencity,13;18
797,"If we look at official statistics of the industrialized and developing world , we immediately realize that the number of cars has been constantly increasing over time .",,
798,In some cases the growth rate has increased too .,growth,4
799,Therefore I would be tempted to say that I disagree with statement .,tempted,4
800,"However , a more careful analysis should be performed .",,
801,"For instance , we should take into account that public transports have become a must in several cities in the world because parking space is limited and there is so much traffic that it would be impossible to arrive at work on time if people went by car .",,
802,"A lot of countries have given a lot of incentives towards more environment-friendly means of transportation such as gas or electricity-lowered ones , reducing the price for tickets .",,
803,At the same time a charge has to be paid to enter the center of a lot cities .,,
804,Therefore there are elements that could certainly discourage the use of private cars and encourage the use of public transports .,elements,3
805,"Up to here , we have talked about the use of public transports within cities , but similar arguments could be made for long-distance journeys .",,
806,Now-cost airlines have spread out throughout all Europe .,spread;out,3;4
807,High-speed railways are being built and there are a lot of high speed trains already in operations in Japan .,,
808,"All these technologies responds to a particular need , that is the possibility of moving faster from one town to another in a very short period of time .",responds,3
809,"This , for obvious reasons , can not be achieved by using a private car .",achieved,9
810,"For instance , in order to come and take this test I took a high-speed train from Naples to Rome which takes only one hour .",takes,21
811,"Hence , I did not have to wake up too early this morning , I took the underground , and the train , then the underground in Rome .",,
812,I had no parking problems at all and this evening I can attend my best friend s birthday party back in Naples .,,
813,"Probably , by using my own car this would have been much more difficult and stressful , if not impossible .",,
814,"In conclusion , if I follow the line of reasoning above I have to agree with the statement .",follow;the;line,5;6;7
815,"Using alternative means of transportation to cars is more comfortable in many occasions and it is becoming more and more comfortable over time , then the number of cars should decrease in twenty years .",comfortable;comfortable,9;20
816,I totally agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people .,,
817,"Young people have a lot of lifetime , healthy , and have many good communities .",have,2
818,The first reason is that they have a lot of lifetime .,have,6
819,"Most of people in my country , Japan , live more than 75 years .",,
820,"Therefor , young people like my age , 25 years old , we have more about 50 years lifetime .",have,13
821,"We can buy a lot of things with money ; however , we canotbuy any time .",buy,15
822,Time is one of the most important tings to enjoy our life so I think young people can enjoy life a lot .,,
823,The next reason is that young people are really healthy .,,
824,To be healthy is really important to enjoy our life .,,
825,"If we are healthy , we can do everything what we want .",,
826,"We can do every kind of job what we want , and we can study a lot in everywhere .",,
827,"We can do every kind of sports to have enjoyable time , and can travel everywhere that we want .",,
828,"Even if we donothave much money to do entertainment or other things , it is possible to make money to do what we want .",,
829,The third reason is that young people have a lot of community .,have,7
830,"Young people unsually keep in touch with their friends from their hometown , school , and so on .",keep;in;touch,3;4;5
831,"They both young and have a lot of time , so that they can enjoy a lot of things together .",have,4
832,"Also if we have a lot of community , maybe we can get a lot of help .",have,3
833,"It is really helpful and that can make our life going well , so that we can enjoy our life itself a lot .",going,10
834,It is really fun to spend time with other people .,spend,5
835,To keep a good relationship with others can make our life great .,keep,1
836,Thus I totally agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than old people .,,
837,"I totally agree with this statement , although it is rather simplistic .",,
838,"I think in fact that it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are , but maybe this is just due to the location of the advertisement for example a beach or a wonderful house or because of the short time they have to present the product , so sometimes a thing is shown really fast , when it is actually not .",,
839,"Nevertheless I think that these are the only aspects that could be justified , but they are marginal aspects , not the core ones .",marginal;core,17;22
840,It is a shame to make something seem fabulous when it is absolutely not or when it does not function at all .,,
841,I believe that the media companies should avoid this kind of false advertising .,,
842,"Many surround the product or the brand with fantastic characteristics , implying that the people who wear it or buy it are cool and special .",surround;fantastic,1;8
843,"I strongly believe that this is extremely dangerous for the young spectators , who are particularly sensitive to these aspects and have not a defined personality yet , so they are easily convinceable .",dangerous;defined,7;24
844,"Moreover some could be dangerous even for adults : for example the advertisements on diet products , which are provided with false witnessing and interviews , which explains how many weight they have lost in so little time .",dangerous,4
845,"I am personally particularly against this type of advertisements , because it is no more a matter of buying a television or a fridge which does not function , but rather a matter of health , which is much more important and has to be avoided .",,
846,"In conclusion I think that the only function of advertisement should be that of making the consumer aware of the creation of a new product and not to overwhelm him with false and useless information , although the consumer should be however critic .",overwhelm,28
847,How many times have you got deceived by commercials ?,,
848,How many times have you regreted buying things you saw on commercials because they were not as good as they seemed ?,,
849,I am sure that this happened to many of you .,,
850,I think that commericals always inflate what products really are .,inflate,5
851,There are many products which are not good and have lots of commercials .,,
852,"On the other hand , there are many products that donotdo much advertisement which are much better than products which advertise all the time .",,
853,So a product having many advertisements doesnotnecessarily mean that the product is good .,,
854,I can speak about this out of experience .,,
855,I once saw an advertisement on the television about a solution that removes all types of stains .,,
856,I was so thrilled by the advertisement that I bought one for me and one for my sister .,,
857,One day my friend came to my house and she spilled blueberry juice on her white shirt .,,
858,I proudly got the solution and rubbed it on the stain as instructed .,,
859,"Shockingly , I figured out later that the more I rubbed the more the stain spread .",,
860,I was very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day .,throw,10
861,"In addition , a lot of the things mentioned in advertisements are incorrect .",,
862,I once saw a toothpaste commercial that stated that this toothpaste gives twelve-hour protection to the teeth from decay and plaque .,,
863,"As a dentist , I knew that this didnotmake any sense .",,
864,There is no such thing as twelve-hour protection .,,
865,It is well-known that plaque starts growing on teeth right after you brush them .,,
866,"Unfortunately , false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers .",lead;waste;loss,4;7;11
867,"Therefore , I think that there should be a commitee to supervise what is being mentioned in advertisments .",,
868,Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .,,
869,"However , where I live , older people are very healthy and active than they used to .",,
870,"In my opinion , older people enjoy more life than younger people do .",,
871,"The first reason of this is that because older people have more time and money than their counterpart , they can do a lot of activities they want to .",have,10
872,"For example , my parents are both retired .",,
873,They have a lot of free time than I have .,have;free;have,1;5;9
874,"In addition , they worked for more than 35 years , so they have a large amount of money they can spend .",,
875,That s why they travel almost once a month across my country and they have already visited all the prefectuers in my country .,,
876,"On the contrary , I have to work every day and I have less available time and money since I got a job last year .",have;less;available,12;13;14
877,I was not able to go somewhere even in summer vacation .,,
878,"Another reason is that young people have more concerns about their futures , compared to the optimistic opinions showed by older people , which leads to the young people s negative ideas about their lives in general .",have;leads,6;24
879,One illustration that makes this clear is that most of the young people concerns about their pensions they will receive in the future .,,
880,"Now that the aging society in my country is getting serious , young people may not receive enough money to live on after their retirement .",on,21
881,"Therefore , most of them have to save money for their future lives and they can not afford to enjoy their present lives .",,
882,"My consideration with respect to the available time and money as well as the negative ideas about future lives , I think that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .",available,6
883,"In my opinion most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but I think it s the marketing way .",,
884,"It s absolutely compressible that a company wants seem an his product better than it really is ; a company , in fact , have to see multiple factors , like for example the actractivity of the market , the other concurrent companies and in this situation the impact with the customers is fundamental .",actractivity;impact,34;48
885,"We can think , to understand the concept , how much advertisement is watched on tv ; if a message is received from a lot of people , a certain product can be buyer from a large part of the population .",,
886,"Probably this way is not ethically correct ; a person can be fascinated from a particular type of product , after the view of the advertisement , and then he can discover that this product is not what he expected .",,
887,"But I repeat that this is the market law , so the companies canotmake in other terms .",law,8
888,I think the positive way of this process is that a good product can have a lot of visibility wih the advertisement .,visibility,18
889,"My mind goes , for example , to Linux , an alternative software ; most of IT s experts say it s better then Windows , but it doesnothave the necessary visibility and many other factors : for example Linux is not organized as a company like his concurrent to fight it .",goes;visibility;fight,2;33;52
890,"In many cases I have choosen a product for the fantastic advertisement of that product ; I like very much Coca - Cola , I ever buyer it , probably I d prefer Pepsi , but I have never buyer it , because I m a fanatic customers of Coke , in part for his beautiful advertisements , that remind me when was a cold .",fanatic,46
891,"In other words , a lot of advertisements can decide the consumption of a produc",,
892,i agree that is most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .,,
893,"for example last week i saw an advertisement about soup for cleaning the car , they said it w ll clean any think including hard spots so i try that products and it doesn do any thing for my car , may be the normal soup is better than this products .",,
894,"another advertisement was talking about some food and they say it is very healthy and good for your body do i buy it too , but after i try it i dont thing i feel any changes .",talking,3
895,and there is some products for a fat peoples they said it w ll make you lose wight and make you thinner but alot of peoples try thats products and didnotlose any wight .,,
896,but some times there a honest advertisments .,,
897,for example there was an advertisement about some food and they challenge any one who can prove that is the product has any unnatural products so when some peoples do some tests for this product they say it was true the product does not contain any unnatural products .,,
898,"but the we canotsay about advertisements always make thair products better than they really are and in the same time we can not say the opposite because we have the to faces , honest advertisements and dishonest advertisements .",faces,33
899,"therefore , i thing that back for the persons experians and what he belive in and if the products equal the big advertisment they have so donotbelive any thing you each because some time you just each a mine of layers from this company .",,
900,I sincerely can t say if I totally agree or disagree with this statement and I ll try to explain why .,,
901,"Ideas and concepts are the base for a theory or a sociological movement , but if you don t remember facts , date and names to expose in a discussion , how can you explain or make other people s ideas changing ?",base,5
902,In this statement there s the same topic of difference between theory and experience .,,
903,"I am an Engineer , so I studied a lot of theory and was very important for me to understand concepts before learning facts .",,
904,But as I saw in my life everything must pass thru practice to really understand the value and the importance of lots of theories studied in the past .,pass;thru,9;10
905,Just think about Newton s discovery of gravity .,,
906,If I should explain people how do work all the forces interested in that phenomenon it would take much more time than making an experiment of an object maybe an apple !,forces,10
907,falling down to the ground .,,
908,Surely now that I ve practiced the theory I can better understand all the concepts behind the main idea .,behind,15
909,This scientific method I think it can be applied to every field of culture and maybe to lifestyles .,,
910,I can bring another simple example of what I mean about the difficult to agree or disagree with that statement and the differences between learning facts and understanding concepts .,,
911,"In history there was a lot of important facts and if we don t try to study and understand the psychology behind some characters of an event , we can t surely have an our own opinion about it : so we see that are important the ideas .",behind,21
912,"But if we don t care about the timeline in which the facts happened we risk to lose the most important informations of when , where they happened !",lose,17
913,Just think about the Wars .,,
914,"Are important theories , ideals , and strategies as well as the dates in which the wars started and ended .",,
915,I totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .,,
916,Surely it is useful and necessary to have knowlege of ideas or concepts when a student claims his her ideas .,,
917,"However , I do not think studying and understanding them is more important to learn facts .",,
918,I am from Japan .,,
919,I studied the soil democracy and neo liberal in Japan .,,
920,Then I believed Japan need to adapt the policy of soil democracy like many European countries because recently the employment in Japan have been unstable although Japanese MNCs have increased thier sales and government has decreased the corporation tax .,unstable,24
921,So I believed the welfare system in Europe is better than American small government and strong capitalism .,small;strong,12;15
922,So I came to Europe to study the politics in Europe .,,
923,"However , in Europe I found what I studied in Japan about European society , philosophy and the principle of politics is different from the reality in the society .",,
924,In the theory each person has same right under the law but one day I saw the situations where two black men were rejected by the shop to enter in UK .,under,8
925,Thier behaviors were not problem at all .,,
926,"In Europe I found that if the government try to protect the people s lives , people are not independent about thier lives .",protect,10
927,Also people become intolerant to foreigners .,,
928,The society do not tend to give the oppotunity to foreigners because the government or worker unions give much regulations about employments to the companies so that the rate of umemployment in many European countries are higher than the United States or Japan .,,
929,So there is less chance for me .,,
930,"Besides , I lost many desires to work or study in Europe because many people are so easy going about life because thier lives are protected by the government .",lost;easy;going;protected,3;17;18;25
931,"In addition , at the this christmas vacation , I visited NY .",,
932,Then I felt absolutely comfortable .,,
933,Because Americans whom I talked with are more used to the different culture so that I could feel I am just one of people .,,
934,Also the society inspired me to work in the United States .,,
935,"It was so shocking experience for me because when I had studied political philosophy in Japan , I believed that the social democracy is necessary for Japan .",shocking,3
936,"However , to be honest I feel so uncomfortable in Europe by the facts that I found or experiences that I have learned in Europe .",,
937,"So in conclusion , I strongly disagree with the idea that understanding the concepts or ideas is important than learing the facts .",strongly,5
938,I should have studied in the United States not in Europe .,,
939,I can not deny the fact that some advertisements make products seems much better that they really are .,,
940,"For example , since online shopping is getting more and more common , sometimes I have to buy things only judging from the information provided by the advertisement , and I received a completely different thing from what I expected from the advertisement .",judging,20
941,"However , consumers are getting smarter , too .",,
942,There are many advertisements that shows the real information by various methods .,,
943,There are various types of methods used for advertisement that provide real information .,,
944,"For example , the company provide samples of the products to allow consumers to experience them .",,
945,"With this method of advertisement , the consumers actually use the products by themselves , and they can make a decision to buy it or not .",,
946,It is a good example to allow the consumers to get the real impression of the products .,get,10
947,Another example is that some advertisements provide statistical information .,,
948,The advertiser conducts a marketing research of their own products to show the users impressions or customer satisfaction .,,
949,"In this way , the consumers can get the reliable information of what the users actually thought of the products .",,
950,"Finally , there are many advertisements that a sales representative actually demonstrate how to use the product .",,
951,"The consumers can ask questions about the product at the site , and the sales person answers information of what the customers really need with showing the products .",,
952,"Since the customers are actually looking at the product , it is possible for the consumers to get real information .",,
953,"As a result , customers know that advertisements have a tendency to promote only their good sides , and companies know that it is not enough only to provide good images .",sides,16
954,There are many methods of advertisement that allows consumers to obtain useful information that represents the actual products .,,
955,Many people might find specialization a convincing and advanced position especially in the modern business world .,advanced;position,8;9
956,"It appears to me , however , that those who have broader knowledge of many academic subjects , who might be called generalist , will be getting more and more important .",broader,11
957,"I work in one of the biggest banking groups in Japan , which includes more than 30000 permanent employees and over 10000 part-time employees .",,
958,"Generally speaking , the products and services that a bank provides require high-level and specialized knowledge , particulary in the stage where those products and services are developed and organised .",,
959,"However , those are not provided not only for professionals within the same industry but also for ordinary people who do not have any special know-how or skills of financial instruments .",,
960,"In this marketing stage , the importance of those who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be clearly identified , because such people have a variety of perspectives based on the academic backgrounds and can approach the possible customers from various angles .",broad;perspectives;backgrounds;approach;angles,11;29;34;37;43
961,This is one of the most important elements in promoting and enhancing business .,,
962,"Secondly , according to my business experience , I would like to stress that good managers in an organization often have various academic backgrounds as well as a variety of business experience .",,
963,I am not saying that a specialist who concentrates on one specific subject can not be a good manager .,concentrates,8
964,"However , in most cases , it is the fact that senior managers need to cover extremely wide range of business area .",cover;wide;area,15;17;21
965,"In this context , a company is highly likely to regard those who have broad knowledge based on many academic subjects as potential candidates for good managers or , finally , future board members .",broad,14
966,"In the reasons stated above , I believe those who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are more highly appreciated than are those who specialize in one specific subject , especially in the future business world .",broad,11
967,I agree to the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .,give,11
968,"There are three reasons supporting my idea ; no free time for young people , no space for them to help the society , and lack of relate experience with others .",supporting;free;space,4;9;16
969,"First of all , the young people seem losing their free time .",losing;free,8;10
970,"Since now is the competing era , they need to work as hard as they can to get the good education , which suppose to give them the better future .",competing;era;give,4;5;25
971,"Therefore , young people , including children , are expected to spent as much time as they can make for the prepartion for the coming test .",spent,11
972,"Increasing in number of the cram school , especially the one for young people , creamy shows the fact that many young people are spenting most of their time to study .",spenting,24
973,"Thus , there will be no time for them to help their community .",,
974,"Second , there are no space or role for them to help the society .",space;role,5;7
975,"Nowadays , there are so many crimes that are done by young people .",,
976,"Therefore , people are suspecting on the young people .",,
977,"As a result , even young people willing to help the society , limited spaces are available for them .",limited;spaces,13;14
978,"For example , if the students want to help to wipe off the snow in the deep-snow city , they are checked their name , and school they are going before they can help .",,
979,"If the school is one of that lower level school , they will not be able to help them because of the possibility that the one will cheet the community .",lower;level;cheet,7;8;27
980,"As a result , we can say that even young people want to help the society , the society reject them .",reject,19
981,"Finally , young people lose their chance to have the experience of good co-relationship with others .",lose,4
982,"Because of the lower rate to get job , people are competing all the time ; there are many enemys for the young people .",competing;enemys,11;19
983,"As a result , having good relationship with others , the core idea of helping the community , is hard task for them to think about .",core;task,11;20
984,"If they can not feel the importance of helping each other , they will not think to spent their little free time to help their community .",feel;spent;free,4;17;20
985,"In conclusion , because they are busy , are rejected by society , and have no such idea as correlation with others , young people are not helping their communities , in my point of view .",rejected,9
986,All of those factors are strongly connected for the,strongly,5
987,Travelling is one of most exciting things to do on a holiday .,,
988,"When I have the time , I like to travel alot .",,
989,"I have visited India , Gift , and Morocco .",,
990,There are some difficulties that you might encounter during a vacation .,,
991,For that reason i think that its best to be in a group or to have a tore guide .,,
992,"First , you may have difficulties finding the right place that you want to be in .",,
993,"For example , you might want to visit a certain mall or a mounted but you can not find where it is .",,
994,"More often , you may get lost in the new country .",new,9
995,A tore guide will organize your trip and make your vacation more enjoyable .,,
996,"Second , you may have difficulties with a foreign language or culture .",,
997,"For example , a certain sign in one culture may be offensive in an other culture .",,
998,"Also , a certain word in one culture maybe offensive in an other .",,
999,Having a true guide will avoid you this problems and will help you with the language and the culture .,,
1000,"Third , you maybe defraud by other people in a new country or someone may steal your things .",new,10
1001,"For example , I went two years ago to Morocco .",,
1002,While i was there someone tried to steal my bag and passport .,,
1003,Quickly he failed to do so .,,
1004,Seeing in a group and having a tore guide will be most benefical in that case .,,
1005,"The tore guide will avoid places where you might get hurt in , Also , will make sure that you stay in the most comfortable places .",,
1006,"In conclusion , i think that having a tour guide is very important .",,
1007,"First , a tore guide will help to go wherever you want in the most comfortable ways .",comfortable,15
1008,"Second , a tour guide will help you deal with the new culture and language .",deal;new,8;11
1009,"Third , a tour guide will keep you save in any case .",,
1010,"In my opinion , is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of a specialization in one of them .",broad,8
1011,"I say this because I think that is the best solution in order to find a work in today s society , where companies are continously on change and require a huge flexibility and adaptability for the new works .",flexibility,32
1012,"According to this , school must provide to give a radical instruction , teaching many different subjects .",provide,6
1013,"In this way , each student will have a quite complete background in the field he choose .",complete,10
1014,"I think that also specialization is important for work , of course , because it implies that a person is really good on doing something specific .",,
1015,"But I also think that an high level of specialization could be reached only with years and years of study and work , and school canotgive this opportunity to everybody .",high;level;reached;give,6;7;12;27
1016,"An example : I study design , but lots of kind of designs .",,
1017,"Interior design , virtual design , graphic design and much more .",,
1018,But what I really like to do is Web design .,,
1019,"So , school gives me first the opportunity to learn about different times of design and , second , to understand which is the best for me .",gives,3
1020,"After the school I can specialize myself in Web design by work , because I have a radical preparation that school gave me , and , in the same time , the other students in my class could choose another specialization , according to their preferences .",gave,21
1021,"This model of teaching subjects gives lots of advantages , because it isnotneither rigid nor boring .",model;gives;rigid,1;5;15
1022,"It gives anyone the possibility to choose , without create limits .",gives;limits,1;10
1023,"Academic subjects are only the start up of the student s working life , that he can and must develope in his career .",start;up,5;6
1024,"But at the same time they are very important , because allow the student the opportunity to understand what he really like to do in his future .",,
1025,I agree with that people had better have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .,broad,8
1026,There are two reasons .,,
1027,"First , it make people who do not have broad knowledge oto have difficulties in the companie or society .",broad,9
1028,"When we get jobs or enter the schools , we have oppotunities of talking with many people .",,
1029,"At the time , However , we have only one specific knowledge , for example the knowledge about mathematics , we can speak only about mathematics .",,
1030,It has possibility of giving other people the impression that you are boring person .,,
1031,It is very dagerous and we may be not able to lead a nice our lives in the society .,dagerous,3
1032,"Second , to studying one specific subject make your future very narrow one .",narrow,11
1033,"For example , when the person who have been studying the mathematics in order to be a professor changes his or her mind and the person want to be a animal doctor , what the person should do ?",,
1034,He or she has the knowledge only about mathematics so he or she can not change his or her future job now .,,
1035,The person who have studied only one specific subject can not change or decide their future again once they decided thier future in thier childhood .,,
1036,"In conclusion , to specialize in one specific subject have dagerousness possibilities in deciding of the futures .",dagerousness,10
1037,"Therefore , I agree with the former statement .",,
1038,I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because using cars could pollute the environment and makes people have less oppotunities to exercise .,,
1039,Using cars could hurm and reduce nature that we live in and is essential for us to live .,hurm;reduce,3;5
1040,"As a lot of people know , driving cars could make CO2 , which is found to raise the temperature of earth .",,
1041,"In the fact , CO2 is considered as one of fron gas that could cause Greenhouse Effect .",Greenhouse,15
1042,This is a effect that fron gases that we use in our every day lives cover the earth and prevent it from releasing the heat from the sun to the space .,cover,15
1043,"It is the fact that the the temperature of the surface of the earth is more and more raising today , which already causes floods or droughts .",,
1044,"The act that is producing CO2 is actually said that driving car , so if use keep using them and producing CO2 , we do not know how much it is going to affect on the environment negatively .",,
1045,"Therefore , we have to come up with better rides other than cars .",,
1046,More and more people have less oppotunities to exercise because of cars .,,
1047,"Nowadays , there are lot of people who do not exercise enough and who eat junk food like humbergers or pizza .",junk,15
1048,I understand that people are too busy working or going to schools beacuse they have to arm money for their families and to study to learn a lot of things which are good for them .,,
1049,"However , eating junk food and not exercising surely kill themselves .",junk;kill,3;9
1050,I know a person who uses his car when he goes to a grocery store to get food although it is just 5 minutes far from his house .,,
1051,"I strongly think that he can walk , no , he has to walk .",strongly,1
1052,"If everybody rides a car wherever he or she goes , they are surely going to be out of shape and get diseases like heart attack or diabetes .",out;of;shape,17;18;19
1053,I believe that we should use less cars and walk or ride buckles if the directions are not so far away from we we are .,,
1054,There are two reasons why people use less car .,,
1055,One is that using car could harm the earth because of CO2 that car produce .,harm,6
1056,The other one is because using cars make people have less oppotunities to exercise .,,
1057,I agree with the sentence that most advertisements and most negative spots make products seem much better than they really are .,spots,11
1058,This is real for lots of reasons .,,
1059,"Firstly , a company which product a good or a service want always show the best in its business expecially when it want to compete with another group wich sell to people the same article .",,
1060,"For this reason they often tell people lies about their good through television , city posters or magazines and people trust it , but when someone buys their famous thing , is not really how they describe to us !",,
1061,"For example , one day my mother had decided to buy an hair-pon which should resist to water and repared you from electrical waves but when it fall in the ground with some water drops she broke it .",resist;repared,15;19
1062,She was so scared !,,
1063,"Secondly , for new objects we have not the idea of the name of who product it .",,
1064,If I buy a Valentino s dress I think it would be better then an H M s one because the name is very important and show you the past of a work group .,,
1065,The companies which obtain the fame with their goods and their service have a best expectation in the consumer and the satisfaction of an expectation create fidelity in the buyer .,create,25
1066,"In conclusion , I think advertisements are often a lie or an enlargement of the real usefulness of an object but I think also that someone with their work have increase their fame in people in a good way .",enlargement,12
1067,We can say the most of the young people not all of them enjoy life more than older once .,,
1068,"The causes of that is that they do not bare big responsibilities on there shoulders , they are only responsible of themself and most of the time they can rely on the help of the parents if they are in trouble ; This category is composed mainly composed of high school or university students .",bare;big;shoulders;rely;in,9;10;14;29;39
1069,"And an important factor that young s tend to explore life more , try new experiences , go places they never visited .",explore,9
1070,"An important factor also is the biological factor , young people have the energy to try new stuff and enjoy there life to the max .",have;max,11;24
1071,"In the opposite , old people mostly have big responsibilities .",big,8
1072,Most of them have children who dependent of them .,,
1073,They have to provide stability inside there families ; financial and psychological .,stability,4
1074,"Old poeple calculate more there steps , they can not take risks because any false step can have bad consequences on them and there dependent .",calculate;steps;false;step,2;5;14;15
1075,"We do not have to forget the biological factor in here also , old people can not have the same eager and the energy to explore and they are not vibrant as the youngs .",have;explore;vibrant,17;25;30
1076,But the last 2 paragraphs do not represent all the population .,,
1077,"There are lots of young people who have big responsibilites because they can not depend on others for help , so they have to work to support themself and sometimes support there families .",big;support;support,8;26;30
1078,This category of youth do not enjoy its life as others .,,
1079,"We have also old people who have financial security and stability , this category tend to enjoy life more .",security;stability,8;10
1080,Then as a conclusion this statement donothave a simple YES or NO answer .,,
1081,"Agreeing or desagreeing to it depends of personality of the person s personality , his environement and his responsibilities .",environement,15
1082,"Like we have learned from the book entitled The end of History , in wich the author held the thesis that after the fall of Berlin wall the history had come to an end , trying to make forecasts on such a long period as 20 years is very dangerous , but I feel fair comfortable with saying that such a diffused mean of transportation as the car will not disappear in two decades , and even that the number of cars will actually increase .",held;dangerous;comfortable;diffused,17;49;55;61
1083,"The car is the engine of modern economy , because it allows fast travel , which in turn means that people with the right knowledge or skill can be quickly and easily collected in the place where they are needed , thus rendering easy both to use their existing knowledge and to build new .",engine;collected;build,4;32;52
1084,I am thinking about workers commuting to their job places or professors reaching universities by car .,reaching,12
1085,"Public transport has proved unable to be a full substitute of cars in this role , and as new economic powers like China and India emerge from poverty they will develop their car population as rich countries have already done , and this process will take more than 20 years , in my opinion , so that the number of cars will keep increasing over this period .",emerge;population;take,25;33;45
1086,"Of course my analysis can not foresee an eventual technological revolution that could render the car useless , like the car has done with horses in the twentieth century , or a major economic breakdown which would render cars too expensive to be useful , but such trend breaking events are unpredictable .",revolution;breakdown;breaking,10;34;48
1087,"If the actual trend of the world will hold , it can be asserted that it will take more than twenty years for the number of cars to start decreasing , if it will ever do so .",hold,8
1088,Nowadays life is tough and expensive and young people have a lot of responsibility in their life .,tough,3
1089,"Depending on the economic system and depending on the country where they live , most of the young people have to study to get a diploma to be able then to find a job to earn money and be independant from their parents , so studying takes a lot of time and some of them need to work as well as to study , so it would be very hard to hep other or give time to the community .",takes;give,46;74
1090,"To stay healthy , most of the young people spend time in the gym or practicing sport outside and that will take an extra time .",spend;take;extra,9;21;23
1091,"A small percentage of young people get engaged very early and maybe they have family to take care of so this will lead to lack of free time other than for the family members and for work , depending on the employment law , young people would need to work full time duty and would not have time to help outside .",lead;lack;free;have,22;24;26;56
1092,"when young people come from wealthy families , or depending on the family education they have , maybe these conditions will allow them to be helpful for their communities to improve the community they are living in , to help needy people , and each young person can participate with his personnal skill and possibility for the best of all the community members .",,
1093,"Everyone of us can be a active member to help others , because in that way we can be stronger ans life may look easier to us and to others and who knows , maybe oneday we will need help so we will be happy to find support from others .",active;stronger;support,6;19;47

1096,I do not agree nor disagree with the statement .,,

1102,"For example certain words are allowed to be used in me country but not allowed in other contries , so when I visit that other country I would say a world that would cause a big trouble for me On the other hand , when traveling in a group the individuals will be tied up with the group , sometimes we need to spend some family time to explore the country weare visiting and try some restaurants , spend more time in a music and buy some sevoniers .",tied;up;spend;spend,53;54;63;78

1106,"To travel with a tour guide is very important because the tour guide know everything in the city and he knows where is the tourist places and where is the shops , museums , restaurant , hotels and alot more things , for example if you travel to a city for the first time and you donotknow about it you wont know where to go and you donotknow where is the tourists places in the city for and where is the good restaurants and museums and it well take you alot of time to know it but if you go with a tour guide he well take to the interesting places in the city and he will explain for you every thing about the city but if you travel alone you wont know where is the interesting places in the city and also when you go to a country that dont speak your language who can you talk to the people who can you reed the sings with out the tour guide you",take,92

1145,"Consequently , with their good planning , older people would only spend mony on what they wanted to see and enjoy .",,
1146,Whilst younger people would run out of money and usually regret some of the things they did not see in their vacation .,,
1147,"In addition , older people would have more money to enjoy life with than younger people .",,
1148,Older people are more established in their careers and therfore more financially sound and actually save have saved their money to enjoy their lives at this stage .,established;sound;stage,4;12;26
1149,Whilst younger people may not have as much money to enjoy life with as some of them may be in school or not employed .,,
1150,Some of them may have not even thought of a career at this point in their lives .,point,13
1151,"On the other hand , there are always exceptions as there are younger people who do plan well , are established in their careers , and are financially well off .",established,20
1152,"But generally speaking , due to their life experiences , older people plan well , established in their fields , and are financially more sound than younger people .",established;sound,15;24
1153,Many advertisements are in the world .,,
1154,There are advertisements which is daily goods .,,
1155,"There are advertisements which is choose , or bat for holies .",,
1156,"But , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .",,
1157,So I agree with this suggestion .,,
1158,"Many people have a personal computer , and use the inter net .",,
1159,Inter net have a lot of advertisements and we can buy goods on the inter net .,,
1160,"When I was a high shool student , I was interested in buying on the inter net Because I entered a soccer team , I would like to a soccer choose .",,
1161,"So I bought a soccer those on the inter ner , but this choose was completely difference at advertisement .",,
1162,"In addition , this choose s size is short at the advertisement .",,
1163,There are many advertisements about food on the TV .,,
1164,People think that they would be liked to eat this food by the advertisements .,,
1165,I would be also liked to eat by the advertisement .,,
1166,"I often order pizza , but this pizza often different from advertisements .",,
1167,"This size is not large such as picture , and food does not looks fresh .",,
1168,There are many advertisements about clothes on the paper .,,
1169,"In Japan , Most of the advertisements is aobut clothes from big department store .",,
1170,They often discount when closes will not different season .,,
1171,"So , people go shopping to buy these clothes .",,
1172,I also go shopping to buy these clothes .,,
1173,"But , I will not want to buy most clothes , when I go to the department shop , because many clothes is so different from advertisement .",,
1174,"Therefore , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .",,
1175,advertisement is so different,,
1176,I personally agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .,give,12
1177,I may say that this aspect of our contemporary society is not due to the selfish behavior of new generations ; there is something deeper that can explain this situation .,deeper,24
1178,"We belong to the internet era ; everything is flowing , everything is moving very quickly .",belong;era;flowing;moving;quickly,1;5;9;13;15
1179,The society and its way of living have changed a lot from the with century : nowadays people have less time for themselves and so for the others .,have;less,18;19
1180,"Although helping poor and needy people and other remarkable activities are still commom in our communities , very few young people do that , just because they are not educated to ; the will to help their own communities is something that young people have to find inside themselves and only their parents can help them in this .",find;inside,46;47
1181,To sum up I might say that every era in history has its own children .,era;has;children,8;11;14
1182,The localisation era has been making the world like a big total town ; everything is near or it seems to .,era;town;near,2;12;16
1183,In this situation we can understand why a little community may not catch the attention of young people ; they are sons of the world and they might find difficult to look at it from the perspective of a little town .,catch;sons;world;look;perspective;town,12;21;24;31;36;40
1184,I donotcompletely agree with this statement : In my opinion both the understanding of ideas and concepts and the learing of facts are important to the cultural growth of a student .,growth,29
1185,"As a matter of fact , many times , ideas and concepts are consequences of facts happened in that period .",consequences,13
1186,"Consequently , students can understand ideas better if they know in what environment these concepts were born : the facts can describe the context in which those ideas grew up .",environment;born;grew;up,12;16;28;29
1187,"Following this view , we have to know the importance of the history studies : only throught the knowledge of our past we can completely understand ideas and concepts that grew up in those periods .",grew;up,30;31
1188,"For example , only if we undestand what were the economic problems during the with-with Century we can fully comprehend the Industrial Revolution and its new ideas of mass production .",fully,18
1189,"But the opposite can also be true : some new ideas can change the behavior of people , so resulting in new events in the human history .",,
1190,"For example , some new ideas in the world of the Physic were followed by the Atomic Bomb and by its use during the World War II .",world,8
1191,In the same way we could mentioned the new researches in the genetic field : surely these new ideas will change the world of tomorrow and will give the true prospective throught which read the future facts .,world;tomorrow;give,22;24;27
1192,"In these terms , it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it it for them to learn facts .",,
1193,What is really important is to undestand that you can not fully comprehend a concept without knowing the context in which this new idea was born .,fully;born,11;25
1194,"Have you never observed general behavior of a group of people , let us say a school class ?",,
1195,"If you have , you probably distinguished some particularly shy students , some other more quiet or polite .",,
1196,"Among these behaviors , you surely have been able to notes the most brave one , the one who did something that nobody else did .",,
1197,This is the leader .,,
1198,"The leader is , for instance , the student who have the courage to tell the professor about something inconvenient .",,
1199,"If we bring this situation out of the school , we can say that the leader , the successful person , is the brave one .",,
1200,"Thi means that those persons who have never the courage to try something hard , different and new , have few possibilities to succeed .",,
1201,"One reason for wich I believe that brave people are likely to be successful is that they normally love challenges , and challenges are opportunities to learn .",,
1202,A genuine curiosity also characterizes brave people often .,,
1203,"Curiosity means aquiring a wide knowledge , which a good starting point of a successful life .",wide;starting;point,4;10;11
1204,"On the other hand , those who never pluck up the courage to measure themselves against challenging situations have few possibilities to enlarge their skills .",pluck;up;measure;enlarge,8;9;13;22
1205,"Moreover , such a behavior reveals scarce curiosity and features people who are not willing to learn and improve themselves .",reveals,5
1206,"The second reason is that successful people definitely need to be self confident , and brave people necessary are .",,
1207,"In fact , a successful life is often the result of many successful battles .",battles,13
1208,"In order to win all these , people must be confident in their abilities .",win,3
1209,I consider brave people to have this approach when they chase new challenges .,approach;chase,7;10
1210,"In conclusion , I definitely believe that a brave approach to challenges is required from those who want to be successful in their lives .",approach,9
1211,"Brave people are not frighten of the events that may occur , and this approach in my opinion is the right one in order to lead the situations .",approach,14
1212,"In my opinion , I think that for students it s more important to learn facts .",,
1213,"During each lecture of something , professors are used to give the students too many ideas and concepts which it will never remain in they brain .",give;remain,10;22
1214,"So , the best way to teach something to the student is give one thousand example about fact that can make improvement to the students .",give,12
1215,On the other hand sometimes is more useful for students just learn the basic of ideas or concepts understood during the lectures or studying in the textbook .,basic,13
1216,"Infact , student s get in trouble when he has to understand a facts which is full of concepts or ideas that they didn study before to hear about the fact .",in;full,5;16
1217,Moreover the answer at the question could be as different as the brain structure of everyone .,structure,13
1218,Although I suggest to everyone to improve herself learning facts I think that for somebody it s not the best way to look for .,,
1219,"Firstly , student who has a good memory should use it to remember the ideas and concept that they have been learn .",,
1220,Instead student who has just a vision memory might use this memory remembering all the images presented in a lecture as a fact explaining the issue .,,
1221,"Moreover , who get easly in confusion reading different concepts , most of the times difficult concepts , could undestand what he has to do in some exercise or in any text where s showed the issue .",in,5
1222,"Finally , I think that students have to do want they want",,
1223,"There are two type of successful people I think : the first one is the person , who reached the success with the own forces .",reached,18
1224,"This kind of successfully person is intelligent , quick , knows the meaning of the word work , all that he has it have been earned from higher , so he knows exactly how to do the job or how to behave in varies occasions .",earned,25
1225,"For this reason I donotagree with the statement because I think this kind of person will surely try new things or take some risks to reach what he wants to or to improve in higher job , because he is sure , competent and respectable .",reach,27
1226,"However in my mind ther s another kind of succesful people , those who reached the success because this success has been gifted to they .",reached;gifted,14;22
1227,"In this case the person has not the quality to be a successful person because he didnotwork hard to reach higher life s purpose , he doesnotkonw how to work well or how to behave in some kind of circumstances and first of all ther s the risk that the success can have a too big weight for he and this kind of people could crash down .",reach;too;big;weight;crash;down,21;58;59;60;69;70
1228,"I think they would never take into account to take a risk or trying new things , because they know that in case of a big problem they wouldnotknow how to solve it .",,
1229,They would of course look for the help of other people .,,
1230,Because of those reason I agree and disagree with the statement in the same time .,,
1231,"All that concern the choices of a person depend on so many things like character , ability , past and also a little bit of luck .",,
1232,"Although it is good to specialize in one subject , I agree with the opinion that people have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .",broad,20
1233,"First , even if you are interested in that one subject you study , you had better to see other subjects .",see,18
1234,Seeing other ranges will be helpful to enlarge your knowledge .,Seeing;ranges;enlarge,0;2;7
1235,"If you see many things and read many kinds of books , your brain and feelings will be soft and you can learn more things than before .",see;soft,2;18
1236,"Secondly , it will also help you to make it sure what you have learned .",,
1237,"In one way , you can not know what is correct or not because your sight is narrow and small .",sight;narrow;small,15;17;19
1238,"If you learned something about the one specific subject , you can not say that in other subject the same .",,
1239,You have to see it from many ways or you can not judge it .,see;from;ways,3;5;7
1240,"And also , all academic subjects connect to each subject .",connect,6
1241,We exist in this world and many materials exist together in a complex way as well .,,
1242,"Although each subject might look different at all , in fact , they are telling us about this world .",telling,14
1243,"Unexpectedly , all subjects are same things .",,
1244,"In sum , I support the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects with those three reasons after all .",broad,13
1245,There is a growth in population .,,
1246,"Year by year , the estimated number of people on earth is multiplying .",multiplying,12
1247,"With this population outburst , more cars will have to be present to meet the needs of the people .",outburst;meet,3;13
1248,"Also , people are getting lazier each year and they will need a form of transportation to move them around .",,
1249,"For those reasons , I think that in twenty years there will be many more cars in use than there are today .",,
1250,It has been mentioned in more than one official estimate that there is an uncontrollable population growth in the world .,,
1251,"In under-developed countries such as the South Asian countries , for example India and Pakistan , a normal family consists of six to eight children .",,
1252,"In gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar or Bahrain , a family is considered big only if the number of children exceeds six .",,
1253,Now multiply those number with the numbers of families in each country and calculate how many people will be present in the world in twenty years .,,
1254,Imagine how life would be if fewer cars were used .,,
1255,How will people move from one location to another ?,,
1256,Some argue that there are laws these days preventing families from having too many babies .,,
1257,"For instance , the Chinese law that states that no family should have more than one child .",,
1258,"Even with those laws , one can not stop the rapid growth in population .",,
1259,Another arguement proposed is that women these days are choosing not to marry for they have more job opportunities and can live independantly .,,
1260,"New estimates show that the number of women is larger the number of men so even if 25 of the women in the world decide not to marry , there will still be 75 who are willing to settle down with a husband and have as many children as he wants .",settle,38
1261,Population growth will continue to be a problem and more cars will have to be produces to satisfy the people .,,
1262,"Unfortunately , each generation produced is lazier than the generation before it .",,
1263,"By the time we reach the year 2026 keeping in mind that the year now is 2006 , the level of laziness will reach its peak .",reach;level;reach;peak,4;19;23;25
1264,This is really sad but it is a fact that we must heard to deal with .,,
1265,"People at that time in the future wouldnotwant to move around on foot , or bicycles or any other form of transportation that would tire them .",,
1266,The only way to solve this problem is by having more cars to satisfy the needs of the generation will come .,,
1267,"As my mother would always say , What a lazy generation !",,
1268,"If that is what she keeps on saying about the present generation , imagine how it would be twenty years from now .",,
1269,"It has been said that because of the population growth , there must be fewer cars .",,
1270,Imagine life with so many cars !,,
1271,"Pollution will certainly be a problem , the streets will be much more crowded and people will have problems reaching their destinations in time for important meetings or deadlines .",reaching,19
1272,As much as I am aware of this problem we have to shine light on another important point .,shine;light,12;13
1273,Men are very lazy .,,
1274,They wouldnotwant to walk to reach their goal or ride the bike .,reach,7
1275,"Unless a new method for transportation is invented that will not tire out the new generation , more cars will have to be present by that time .",,
1276,Population growths and the laziness of new generations are two main factors that will increase the number of cars that will roam the streets in the future .,roam,21
1277,I am fully aware of the problems that will occur because of this but one can not live in denial all of his life .,,
1278,We need more cars .,,
1279,How else are we going to move around ?,,
1280,"Unless a new solution is proposed for transporting comfortably from one place to another , cars will continue to multiply in number as people do .",comfortably;multiply,8;19
1281,I agree with this statement .,,
1282,"In fact , I m sure that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .",,
1283,Everyone knows about the catastrophic consequences deriving from pollution .,catastrophic;deriving,4;6
1284,"For example , our planet is becoming warmer and warmer and the sea level increased rapidly in the last few years .",,
1285,"I think that pollution is a great problem , but I believe that we can do something in order to save the earth .",save,20
1286,What can we do ?,,
1287,"We can prefer public transport , such as buses or metros , to cars .",,
1288,"For instance , every day I go to university on foot .",,
1289,"It s a good attitude , because I can have some physical movement , I can meet friends on my way , I can stop for a while to buy a newspaper and , most of all , I can enjoy my city .",,
1290,I relax when I go out for a walk and I suggest that you try to do the same thing .,,
1291,"So , I suggest that you prefer ecological means of transport in order to respect our planet and to defend it from pollution .",respect;defend,14;19
1292,"Public transport is less expensive than cars , so that you can spend that money in other ways .",,
1293,"Moreover , through buses you can socialize , you can share the travel with others or , if you are lucky , you can meet interesting people on your path .",share,10
1294,"For example , last week , while I was coming back home , I met Giovanni Sartori , an Italian writer .",,
1295,I was very surprised !,,
1296,"I asked him some question about his latest work , called La mala costituzione .",,
1297,He told me that he prefers taking the bus because it helps him to feel close to common people .,close;common,15;17
1298,"I agree with this idea , because I think that through public transport you can share , not only a travel , but also feelings and emotions .",,
1299,"In conclusion , I suggest that you abandon you cars and you start taking buses for three simple reasons : first of all , you can contribute to save the planet from pollution ; secondly , buses are cheaper than cars ; finally doing so , you can enjoy the atmosphere of your city .",abandon,7
1300,There is a great range of opinons about whether people agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .,range,4
1301,Some people might agree with this statement and other people might disagree with this statement .,,
1302,"As far as I am concerned , I disagree with this statement because many people can achieve their success by not taking risks and improving what is well-known .",,
1303,I like to focus on these reasons in more detail .,focus,3
1304,The first and primary reason for my belief is that many people can achieve their success by avoiding risks .,,
1305,"For example , if people can learn a lot of information from other s failure , they might be successful without taking risks .",,
1306,"To give my family s example , when my grandfather started new business in any fields , he always reached about the failure examples conducted by other people because failure example taught him why these businesses were not successful .",taught,31
1307,He was so prudent that he could make his success without taking any risks .,make,7
1308,This example shows that people can be successful not by taking risks but by avoiding risks .,,
1309,That is why I disagree with this statement .,,
1310,Another reason why I disagree with this statement is that people also can be successful not by trying nestlings but by improving what is well-known .,,
1311,"One example that comes to mind quickly is the Japanese internet shopping site , so-called Taken .",comes,3
1312,This internet site always did not provide new technology and methods to customers .,,
1313,"However , this company was always thinking about how to attract their customers and make customers buy easily .",attract,10
1314,Then it improved their site constantly .,,
1315,"Finally , this company dominated internet shopping site without introducing new technology .",dominated,4
1316,I think this example shows people can be successful without trying new things .,,
1317,"Considering all these facts I mentioned above , there is no doubt that I disagree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .",,
1318,"Of course , I can not deny that many successful people tried new things and took risks .",,
1319,"For example , Sony , a famous global company in Japan , always tried new things and provided new electric appliances , such as portable radio and video games .",,
1320,"However , I still disagree with this statement because many people can achieve their success by avoiding risks and improving what is well-know .",,
1321,"Although not perfectly , I agree with that statement , because it is obviously that young people , of course including me , do not help our comunities .",,
1322,I think the biggest reason why is that the connection with each other became very weak .,connection;weak,9;15
1323,"30 or 40 years ago , when my parents were in our ages , there were very strong connection with neighbors .",strong;connection,17;18
1324,"Sometimes they took care of their neighbor s babies , or made the dinner and share with neighbors .",,
1325,"They often helped each other , so it was usual to help their comunities .",,
1326,"However , now , there are many apartment houses , and many people live in another cities which they did not grow up .",,
1327,"Then , the connection is becoming weak and weak , and sometimes we do not know who is the neighbors .",connection;weak;weak,3;6;8
1328,"If we do not know the people in our comunity , probably we do not have the feeling to spend the time to help our comunity .",spend,19
1329,"In addition that , we have few time to help our comunity .",have,5
1330,"we have schools , part time jobs , working every day .",,
1331,And also the most of us leave home eary in the morning and come back home late in the night .,,
1332,"In such a lifestyle , we have no time to help other people .",have,6
1333,"But , on the other hand , there are some young people to have enough time to help their comunities .",have,13
1334,"For examples , the people from the families who live the same comunity since the generations of their parents or grandparents .",,
1335,"Such young people understand the comunities , so they can help them easily if they have something to do .",,
1336,"In conclusion , I agree with that statement , but not perfectly .",,
1337,"As I mentioned above , I know some people have enough time to help their comunities even if they are very busy .",have,9
1338,"So , if they have the connection with their communities , they can help their comunities and also , they would make the time to do that .",connection;make,6;21
1339,"It is a fact that if the students do not understand a concept and do not understand the ideas , the things surrounded by them would not make any sense and there wouldl be a confusion .",surrounded,22
1340,"At the same time , it is also important to learn facts which make the things real to the students and students can easily visualize the things and can develope their own thoughts and ideas .",visualize,24
1341,I had an experence related to how important it is learn the fact than understanding ideas and concepts ; therefore I disagree with the statement .,,
1342,"When the student can see the fact , they can accept a reality they face , develope their ideas and think deely and as the result , they will be more independent .",see;face;develope;deely,4;14;16;21
1343,"Before I had a situation to do a lab experiment in my chemistry class , my teacher taught us what the purpose of the experiment and explained the steps but it was not realy helpful for me to visualize what I suppose to do .",steps;visualize,28;38
1344,The lab was not appeal to me and I found it was boring becasue I could not use my thoughs to think deeply .,appeal;deeply,4;22
1345,I thought It was really passive way of leaning .,passive,5
1346,"Then , in my physics class , the other showed me the lab in front of the class and told us the all the facts what is happening in a real life which is realted to this experiment .",,
1347,I could accept the reality of the lab really easily that time .,,
1348,I was able to think beyond the physics experiment .,beyond,5
1349,I also could use my imagination and so my thoughs got really deep .,deep,12
1350,"Form my personal experience , I found it was much better to learn facts as my attitude gets more active and more independent from what the teacher teaches me a concept .",active,19
1351,"I can learn ideas and concepts from text books , so I think it is really important for the sudents to activate their minds and learn the facts .",activate,21
1352,"In my opinion , I think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour give because of several reasons .",,
1353,"First , some people feel more comfortable with the group because they not alone .",comfortable,6
1354,"second , many people likes to leading by a tour guide to show them the places and explain it to them , also the guide usually use the language that the people use it in the country that they traveling to , so that the travelers do not have a language problems during their trip .",,
1355,"Finally , some people like to be organize and follow a scale that they not responsible of it .",follow,9
1356,People will feel comforatable when they travel with a group of other people that probably their first time to see these places too .,comforatable,3
1357,"I belive it will be more intertanments , and make anew friends .",,
1358,"Although , it will be many programs during the trip that will make it better than only trip .",,
1359,"Many people likes to leading by a tour guide to showing them the places , as well to explain it .",,
1360,"The tour guide always known the history of the places the the tour will visit it , so that , the tour get more information about the places that they visit , and learning anew stuff about that place .",,
1361,"Culture , food , clothing , and traditions are the most important issue for the traveling , the tour guide who usually from that place , he is the best one who can explain all these stuff for the group .",,
1362,"However , the guide usually knows the language that uses in that place , as well the language of the group , so the travelers do not have any problems that the may face from that issue .",face,33
1363,"Finally , many people are organizing and they care too much about the time , so that the like to be a part of a group to organize everything for them .",part,22
1364,"Inaddition , traveling is very good thing to learn more about how the other people live .",,
1365,The author is arguing that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .,,
1366,I agree with the author point of view .,,
1367,The number of advertisements has increased .,,
1368,"While watching a TV show , a person will have an interrupting advertisement period in the TV .",,
1369,"In addition , most newspapers have specified a number of pages for products advertisements .",,
1370,This huge number of advertisement has affected our thinking about different products .,,
1371,Companies spends millions of dollars to create convincing advertisements .,,
1372,This spending is considered part of the marketing strategics .,,
1373,"It is well believed that the more advertisement there is for a product , the more it is sold .",,
1374,The millions of dollars that are spent on advertisement is considered only a small amount of money in big companies such as Pizza Hut .,,
1375,"However , these companies do not care if they have to lie in presenting accurate information about their products .",,
1376,"Because of the colored and well designed advertisements , consumer will be confused about the real quality of the product .",,
1377,"Because of advertisements , some products have become more expensive regardless of their quality .",,
1378,"For example , Toshiba labor is a well known brand .",,
1379,"Through out the years , Toshiba has proved that they have good quality laptops .",,
1380,"Overtime , toshiba laptops has become expensive .",,
1381,"Moreover , people around the world have got an idea stick in their mind that toshiba laptops are the best .",stick,10
1382,"However , being a computer specialist , I have noticed that toshiba computers quality has declined .",,
1383,Few weeks ago Toshiba company had to withdraw laptop batteries from the market for a specific toshiba laptop .,,
1384,Poeple who are not interested in reading Information Technology news will not know about the battery withdrawal .,,
1385,They will remain in believing that Toshiba laptop is always the best .,remain;in,2;3
1386,"About nine months ago , I was convinced because of an advertisment that Assets air conditions are of good quality .",,
1387,The company that is advertisement for this brand is well known in my country Oman .,,
1388,"After buying two Assets air conditioners , I found out that these conditions are not as was advertised for .",,
1389,I couldnotstand having them for one months .,stand,3
1390,I had to purchase new air conditions .,,
1391,People spend a lot of money because of the misleading advertisements .,misleading,9
1392,They do not bother searching more about the product before buying it .,,
1393,"It is maybe not worth it to search the internet before buying a can of beans , but it worths a lot to search before buying an expensive products such as a car .",,
1394,"yes , I agree with this statement , it is more important to understand what you are studing in spite of understand few facts , but it is also true that usually fact improve your knowledge of ideas and concepts .",,
1395,"I mean , if you want to understand an ideas you probably need an exemple , this exemple is the fact .",,
1396,"I show you a situation in which facts are extremely releated to the knowledge of a concept : we are in a history classroom , the teacher of an elementary school told his student that the second world war was a very horror event .",,
1397,"The childrens understand the core of the statement , but they donotknow why it is so , or if they really do understand the thing .",core,4
1398,"So the teacher shows some event that occured during the war , like hitler s policy , like holocausts , etc ...",,
1399,"now children has theirown opinion and can actually say that war is bad , because thay understood the concept , that is substained by an exemple , that means , by facts .",substained,22
1400,"IT can be also stated that learn facts over facts can not really help you , because if you donotpay attention to what you are saing you ll never be able to have a true opinion on some topic .",over;pay,8;21
1401,"You have to improve your knowledge by add ideas and concept , with an array of clear facts .",add;array;clear,7;14;16
1402,"Infact it can be inferred that facts are the basis of knowledge because they prepare your mind to a concept , only in this way you can add information .",basis;prepare;add,9;14;27
1403,"More over is true that understand ideas and concept is more useful for you than learn just facts , indeed facts can be learned with a mnemonic process , viceversa an idea have to grown up in you , it have to suggest you something .",grown;up,34;35
1404,"In conclusion maybe the statement should be it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts , supported by an array of facts that cleary explain the content of those ideas and concepts , so I actually can say that I agree the statement .",supported;array;cleary,18;21;25
1405,If I can choose the answer whether I agree or disagree with that the best way is in a group led by tour guide .,,
1406,I definetly choose the answer that I disagree with the statment .,,
1407,I would not like travel by a tour guide .,,
1408,Following I will take specific reasons why I dislike traveling by tour guide .,,
1409,"First , there is great restriction of time if he or she travel in groupe by a tour guide .",restriction,5
1410,"In my case , Now I works very hard in daytime and I might be ordered accidently by the boss to work holiday .",accidently,16
1411,"So as is often to the case with traveling is in a group by a tour guide , when to travel and where to travel is already detained and is not available for me .",,
1412,"Therefore , I prefer to travel alone or with few friend by coordinating easy to suit my own work time .",coordinating;suit,12;15
1413,Second reason I dislike traveling by a tour guide is that guiding can decrease opportunities to communicate people in the destination by using foregin language .,,
1414,"Usually , a tour guide can some foregin language and in travel , a guide translate foreing language of destinations and we do not have to use foreign language .",,
1415,That is nonsense for me because I want to study foreign language especially in my travel .,,
1416,"I beleive that traveling alone , without tour guide is good for improve my speaking foregin languages .",,
1417,"Last , if I travel abroad alone without a tour guide , I can discover something in my travel with my oun effort .",discover,14
1418,That is presure for me !,,
1419,"All above of that , I prefer traveling alone or with few friends to traveling in a group by a tour guide .",,
1420,"Of course , There are some advantages of traveling in a group .",,
1421,"For example , The price of traveling tends to be lower and more economical if we choose traveling in a group .",,
1422,"But , as I take all above of that . , in my opinion , advantages of traveling alone without guide is much greater than these of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .",,
1423,I do agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .,give,9
1424,"This is because by thinking about myself and friends around me , I can not find many young people , who are interacted to the community a lot .",around,9
1425,I believe this culture change is happening worldwide and considered it is usual these days .,,
1426,"When my grandparents are young , they said they remembered that their parents were interacting with the community deeply and felt normal that they had to live in that way .",deeply,18
1427,"At the time when my grandparents are little , the Words War II was happening therefore , strong bond in the community was needed more than nowadays .",strong;bond,17;18
1428,Young teenagers were there to look after the little children and help the old people .,,
1429,That was something they all had to do in order to survive .,,
1430,"However , as the war ended and my parent s generation was born , there was not so much situations needed for people to stick together because that was the only way to survive .",stick,24
1431,My parent s said that they remember that their parent s tell them to care about community and help them since that is how their parent s grew up but my parent s said that they never really understood why .,,
1432,I also do not remember my parents teaching me to interact with community and spend time for it .,interact;spend,10;14
1433,"This can be because in my 17 years of life , I moved more than 10 times because of my father s job and every time I moved to new community , it was hard for our family to join easily .",,
1434,So we were kind of giving up on this kind of culture .,,
1435,"Even if the person never moved around so much , I believe not many people like to interact with community because people became colder about the connection with different people .",colder;connection,23;26
1436,"In western and some parts of eastern countries , the cultural change in religion was also significance to this change .",,
1437,"In old days , religion was strict and if you are christian , you had to attend to mass every Sunday .",strict,6
1438,"However , nowadays , attending to mass is quite free and not many people criticisms you if you do not attend to the mass .",,
1439,"However , it does not mean that spending time for community is wastful because people are acting in this way .",spending;wastful,7;12
1440,Human beings can not live without interacting each other and it is very imporant to be a well being and help each other without benefits .,,
1441,"It is very sad that nowadays young people are not spending enough time for community and for our future , we should connect with people more and create comfortable community .",spending;connect;create;comfortable,10;22;27;28
1442,It is such a hard thing to predict whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there is today or not .,,
1443,There are so many factors leading to the decrease in the number of cars .,leading,5
1444,"Some of these factors are the ever increasing oil price , the scarcity of gasoline and the high cost of car maintenance .",,
1445,"However , there are other factors promoting the use of cars and thus will result in more number of cars in the future .",promoting,6
1446,"In my opinion , I think that the number of cars wonotdecrease .",,
1447,"In fact , I think that there will be more cars in the future , than there are today .",,
1448,"One reason that may lead to the increase in the number of cars used , is the increasing number in population .",lead,4
1449,"The number of people is increasing world wide , and lots of countries are having population control problem .",,
1450,"So , the more people there is , the more the need for cars and transport services .",,
1451,Another reason is the advancement in Science .,advancement,4
1452,"Scientists are finding new energy sources that are abundant , less pollutant and cheap .",,
1453,"Having a cheap energy source decreases the running cost of owning a car , and thus encourages more people to purchase and own cars .",encourages,16
1454,"Moreover , having this source as clean and not a pollutant for the air or the environment will make it easier in terms of regulations to obtain a car .",,
1455,"Last but not least , the advancement in technology is another key reason .",advancement;key,6;11
1456,Advancement in technology will increase the number of cars significantly .,Advancement,0
1457,"With technology advancing , car manufacturers are able to lower their cost of production for cars .",advancing,2
1458,"Thus , it will be possible to produce cheaper cars in shorter periods of time .",,
1459,"Also , the advancement in technology makes it possible for governments to be able to build more bridges and to maintain healthy roads to accomodate more cars .",advancement;healthy,3;21
1460,"To sum up , Its like a supply and demand issue .",,
1461,"With the advancement in science and technology , resulting in increase in supply , and the increasing number of population , resulting in increase in demand , owning a car will be easy and effective .",advancement,2
1462,"So , in Twenty years from now , there will be more cars in use than there are today .",,
1463,I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .,give,11
1464,"Not many young people are seen in community activities , and it seems like their interest is not at their local .",,
1465,Three reasons can be thought of when thinking about this issue .,,
1466,"Firstly , young people seem to be busy with their own life , and has less interest in their own communities .",busy;with,7;8
1467,This is because their everyday life is basically at the school or university .,,
1468,"There , they study on subjects they have interest in , and they may also be participating in a circle or an after school activitiy .",circle,19
1469,"It can be guessed that young people spend more time there , instead of helping out at local communities .",spend,7
1470,"Secondly , the community itself is not systematically organized for young people to participate .",,
1471,The problem of Japanese society now is that the local communities are not working out in many places because people have less contact with their neighbors .,working;out,13;14
1472,"For example , in big cities with people living in high building appartments , it is normal for people to not know most of the people who live there .",,
1473,"You might see some people once in a while , but in a busy life , there is rarely a chance to really get together to form a community .",form,26
1474,"Therefore , young people do not spend time to help out in their communities .",spend,6
1475,"Lastly , the local communities are mainly run by older people , such as people who have retired jobs and have more time .",run;have,7;20
1476,These people gather and organize community activities and spread it to neighbors .,spread,8
1477,"For example , it takes time to organize an event in the community .",takes,4
1478,"You need to plan out things to do , and also go knock on doors to ask for participation .",,
1479,"When there are not enough people , you struggle more and have to work harder .",struggle,8
1480,So it is natural to say that people who have more time has more chance to participate and help out in the community .,have,9
1481,This might be one of the reasons that youg people spend less time in community when compared with older people .,spend,10
1482,"From these three points that I have stated above , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .",give,18
1483,"Young people might be energetic and be a big help , but when their interest is somewhere else , it is difficult to bring back their attention .",somewhere;bring;back,16;23;24
1484,I donotagree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .,,
1485,There are some reasons to dislike to be led by a tour guide while I am traveling in a group .,,
1486,It is not agreeable to my taste .,taste,6
1487,"First , our time is restricted by a tour guide .",restricted,5
1488,That s mean that we canotgo somewhere freely .,,
1489,"At my culture trip on my school event , we canotbehave freely because there is a guide .",,
1490,we have experience many times .,,
1491,We canotbehave freely .,,
1492,"It is hard for us to spend , because ew have to write reports about the place , so we have to be led by a tour guide even we donotlike it .",spend,6
1493,"Second , a tour guide sometime tells a lie .",,
1494,"Last week , I had a culture trip in Switzerland .",,
1495,"I had prepared against report trip , but they are not accorded between the explanation of the document that i had prepared and the explanation of a tour guide , so sometime I am confused , so it is trouble for me to write the reports .",,
1496,"Finally , I think that the best way to travel in a group is that to behave oneself .",,
1497,This action is very good for experiencing some thing in that place .,,
1498,This thing is happy for enjoying at that place .,,
1499,To be led by a tour guide is not happy and awful .,,
1500,"Sometime the explanation of a tour guide is useful and not interesting , so many people shoud travel by own .",,
1501,Sometime we can learn something that a tour guide doesnotknow .,,
1502,"Wherever we go , what ever we find .",,
1503,"There are something who doesnotknow , so when people travel , they should not ask a tour guide , It canotenjoy and become bad trip , so we need to travel without a tour guide .",,
1504,I do not agree nor disagree with the statement .,,
1505,"I strongly believe there are advantages as well as disadvantages in all phases of life , in youth as in old age .",phases,12
1506,"It is generally agreed that young people have strong physical qualities , more energy , and a wide range of opportunities potentially available to them : their life isnotwritten yet .",have;wide;written,7;17;30
1507,"At the same time , older people are weaker , need medical attention with higher probabilities , and do not have many of the choices young people have : because , as you grow older , it becomes too late to seize an increasing number of opportunities , and more doors are closed , so to speak in particular career-wise .",have;too;late;seize;doors;closed,20;38;39;41;50;52
1508,"For example , if a young woman pursuing a career in acting and attending theater classes , is struck all of a sudden by a revelation and decides her true vocation is in marine biology , she simply quits theater studies and enrolls into science school .",pursuing;struck,7;18
1509,"Changing your mind like that would not be possible when you re like , say , 40 years old : no matter how hard you work , the competition will probably have been into your field for 10 or more years than you have , and that kind of gap is practically impossible to fill .",competition;into;gap;fill,28;33;49;54
1510,"So , if you re 40 years old and you ve been , say , a theater actress , you re probably bound to stay that ; or at least , you donothave all the opportunities you d have had , had you changed your mind at a younger age : in short , I guess we can safely say that getting old reduces the opportunities of successfully changing your career field .",bound;to;stay;have;had;reduces,22;23;24;34;41;65
1511,"However , there are clear advantages that go with older age , such as security , reduced uncertainty about the future , the comfort of relying on a family of your own , and that feeling of safety that having a steady job gives you : all this is more likely to happen as age increases .",relying;safety;steady,25;37;41
1512,"It is wise though not to generalize too much : in those countries where the job market does not present high levels of protection , job-security might be low for the old as well as for the young ; and when divorce is a popular behavior , your dream of a happy family can be easily shattered and turn into a nightmare .",dream;shattered;turn;into;a;nightmare,48;56;58;59;60;61
1513,"I disagree with this statment , i think older people enjoy life more then longer ones , becouse older people have the money , the time the and health .",have,20
1514,"As of the money older people have alot of money form their savings over the years , form down sizing as they dont need to be in big houses so they down size as they move in smaller houses and get alot of money from this , also they have their retirement plans which give them good money every month which they can relay on .",relay,63
1515,"As of the time mostof them are retired so they have alot of time to enjoy so you will find them traveling alot engaged in social activity doing fancy sports like golfing , sailing and fishing which need alot of money and time .",have;need,10;37
1516,"if we go through the economics magazines we will find alot of atrticals about the elderly people and the baby boomers and how much they spend on traveling , entertaiment and sports .",,
1517,"Also they have extent health services they have the most advanced health facilities in the world , you can see now that the avarage life span for the female in the USA is 79 years for the male is 73 years , so they have every thing to enjoy thier life .",,
1518,"On the other hand younger people have to work very hard to pay their bills for example if a graduate student is working in a good job and have good career he has to work very hard in order to pay his student loans , if he dosent have a loan he has to pay his mortgage on his house , if a young person doesnot have an academic degree he or she has to work in more than one job in order to live decent life so after a hard working day both of them donot have the time or energy to enjoy or do some thing else , and if they want to do any thing they have to plan it a years ahead charge it on credit card and then pay later over the years with the intrest , also younger people have to work hard and plan for their retirment .",have,97
1519,So after all these resons i think older poeple are enjoying their life more then younger ones .,,
1520,"Young people today are faced with constant pressures from their family , school , and community .",faced;pressures,4;7
1521,The lives of each young person or teenager today focuses around a common goal of education .,focuses,9
1522,With all the pressures of education and family expectations the time that each young person gives to helping the community is not enough .,pressures;gives,3;15
1523,In reality young people today do help the community but the factor that should be looked at is when do they help the community .,,
1524,They help the community every summer when the work load of school is decreased .,work;load,8;9
1525,During the summer young people look for summer jobs helping their families and working in small businesses .,,
1526,These summer jobs that each young person is dedicated to bring the community closer and help the community be stronger for the future .,bring;closer;stronger,10;13;19
1527,Each young person helps the community in an indirect way by working in different aspects to strengthen the bonds of community .,strengthen;bonds,16;18
1528,When a young person works in the Super Market he greets everyone in the community with warmth and works to give an extra hand to the Super Market and this in the long run benefits the community because a strong community is a happy one provided with all their food resources from the Super Market .,warmth;hand;in;the;long;run;strong,16;23;30;31;32;33;39
1529,In another example when a young person volunteers in the summer to work in an orphanage they are helping the community greatly because when any person volunteers they are giving without expecting something back ; they are giving to help the community .,giving;back;giving,29;33;37
1530,The question that should be asked is how much time should each person give to helping the community ?,give,13
1531,Each young person should dedicate the time they gave to helping the community during the summer throughout the whole year .,gave,8
1532,Even if it was for only five minutes a day it would benefit the community significantly in the future .,,
1533,In conclusion young people are helping the community but they need to give more time to helping it .,give,12
1534,I disagree with the statement .,,
1535,Travel around the world is an experience that give you the opportunity to open your mind and develop new points of view .,open;develop;points;of;view,13;17;19;20;21
1536,"Travel is not always connected with as much information you can add to your knowledge , travel is more than that !",connected;add,4;11
1537,It s connected with emotions .,connected,2
1538,A new trip is like a new person in your life .,person,7
1539,"You can imagine how could be this relationship if it s led by someone else , a guide !",relationship,7
1540,You can not plan in advance exactly what you are going to receive from something that you donotknow yet .,receive,12
1541,"Of course you have to make a plan of your trip especially according with your time and budget available , but it s always important have the opportunity to change if you find something that you donotenjoy .",,
1542,"A guide may be usefull for old people , because they have no more the energy to organize all the trip .",energy,15
1543,And travel with other people can be an opportunity to feel more security .,,
1544,The sense of freedom for me is important .,,
1545,It s a waste of time waiting for other decision .,waste,3
1546,"I want Travel alone is also cheaper , because you can choose your own",,
1547,I believe that the young people nowadays are at least trying to give enough time to help their communities .,give,12
1548,It seems as if we are not helping at all because we do not have enough time in our lives to fully commit a hundred percent of ourselves in the service .,have;fully;a;hundred;percent;of,14;21;23;24;25;26
1549,"However , we can help others little by litte .",little;by;litte,6;7;8
1550,What are our communities anyway ?,,
1551,Are they countries or neighbors ?,,
1552,"At least my school , American School In Japan , focuses on service to our communities , both countries and neighbors .",focuses,10
1553,"I recently joined a club in my school called Sok Sabay , which supports Cambodian orphanages to provide home and food supply .",supports,13
1554,It is a non-profit organization and all of our profits that we make as a club goes straight to the shelter in Cambodia .,straight,17
1555,"We sometimes collect clothes , pencils , toys , and books for children and send them .",,
1556,"Then we get thanks letters from those children , which is are primary source of our happiness and motivation for commitment in the club .",,
1557,Sok Sabay is not the only non-profit organization in my school .,,
1558,"There are Habitat for Humanity , Phillipine Relief Organization , and UNICEF .",,
1559,"Most of the students join in one of those clubs , and some of them even join in all of them .",,
1560,"Although we are busy with our lives , we do try to somehow be in part of the service program for other countries .",busy;with;part,3;4;15
1561,"I am also in National Honor Society , which strongly focuses on service program , especially towards our neighbor communities .",strongly;focuses,9;10
1562,"We make rice balls for homeless people on the weekends , and visit orphanage shelter about once a month .",,
1563,"Although it is optional to attend those active , most of the members of NHS help willingly .",,
1564,We also support the Runnathon acitivity once a year with American Club .,support,2
1565,"Moreover , we have meetings almost every week to keep in our minds that we are NHS members and it is necessary to think about the issues of service programs .",keep;in,9;10
1566,We actively help and support our neighbors .,actively;support,1;4
1567,"Although there are young people who do not care about others at all , I believe that people in my school are different .",,
1568,"We know somehow that we should be in part of some services , or at least think about it .",part,8
1569,I do not believe in necessity of having enough time for service .,having,7
1570,"Nothing is enough , therefore , we need to keep reminding ourselves that taking an action worths while .",,
1571,"Even a little action can help someone , and that is how my school builds the sense of service towards others .",little;builds,2;14
1572,I strongly hope so !,strongly,1
1573,"I am rather stuffed by the continous hearing of noisy car , the pollution they produce and the stress they increase in people all the day .",stuffed,3
1574,I think that the number of cars must be reduced for a lot of reason of any kind .,,
1575,"There are too many cars in cities : I m thinking of all the time i have been blocked in traffic , I m thinking at the stress that produce a situation like been in a jungle of clayton sound , peolpe that insult each others with no reason , all the important appointed participated ...",blocked;jungle,18;36
1576,Cars are expensive : since the car has began a status symbol its price has risen enormously .,symbol,11
1577,"And the more people continue buying the cars at any price the more the price will rise Air pollution is caused by car : have you ever asked yourself how does it cost all the publics works to clean the building of the cities from the thick dark layer of smog that cover them ? , or how dose it cost to restore the streets every two years ?",,
1578,The public transport can be more efficient and less stressing : I think that public transport are the ony solution to the problem of the cars .,,
1579,"We offcourse can not avoid to travel , we need to , we only have to consider more efficient way to move .",,
1580,The most important features of public tranport is that the allow many people to travel at the same time with a grate maximization of the result at the same price .,,
1581,"Furthermore there are new technology that use not energy that involve pollution such as solar energy , wind energy and so on .",,
1582,I think that future must go in this direction to have a safe life for us and for future generations .,go;in;this;direction,5;6;7;8
1583,"Although old people are more mature than young persons and they have more money than them to make lots of interesting plans in life like traveling going to fancy restaurants and so on , responsabilities increase with age and i think the more you have responsabilies the less you will get to enjoy life .",increase;have,35;44
1584,the life of a student is full of surprising experiments that someone get to discover day after day .,full;experiments;discover,6;9;14
1585,"there is nothing more interesting that being a simple student who has no responsibility except just studying a little and spending all his free time getting to meet new friends , partying more often .",has;spending;free,11;20;23
1586,"I remember when i was a young person , it was the best time of my life i had meet alot a friends , its true am still in contact with them till now but it is just not the same thing when we were young , we dont see each other more often like we use to do , every time we want to meet we have to schedule our meetings in advance , and even when we meet we dont have fun like we use to do .",have,82
1587,Is it the age or what ?,,
1588,Is it because where are old this is happening ?,,
1589,"we can not stay up late anymore , we are thinking about collecting money and the difficulties and responsabilities of life .",collecting,12
1590,"Another point to be mentioned is the health , i am an athlete , i enjoy doing sport , gathering with my friends around a soccer game , but unfortunately i can not do this anymore .",,
1591,Every time i do a small effort i stop right away because i can not continue .,small,5
1592,It is all related to growing older and older and having alot of responsabilities .,having,10
1593,"Another thing to talk about it the house duties , shoping cleaning kind demands , we have to do all of this over the weekend when we have a little of free time All these things make us more and more busy not enjoying life and days after day with someone becoming older responsabilities increase i think young people enjoy life more than old people .",have;free;increase,27;31;54
1594,It is controversial discussion tp define a positive cause of success in humans life .,,
1595,Some people believe successful people are only from their knowledge that was acquired in previous their life while others do believe that successful people are made up from an effort of trying new things and taking risks .,made;up;from,25;26;27
1596,"Answer for this question varied from what he or her experienced and learned in his or her life , and for me , it is important that to define what is successful life by various aspects .",,
1597,In my case .,,
1598,I tried new things with risks as well as use my knowledge that I already had .,,
1599,"When I was twenty years old , I skied at mountainous areas in my home country .",,
1600,"Before going ski , I learned and practiced what is ski , and the practicable way for improvement my skills of skiing .",,
1601,"I read some books of skiing , watching videos , consulted with my senior friend who is good at skiing .",,
1602,"After arrival of mountain , I realized that the knowledge that acquired before come to skiing is useful .",,
1603,"A book stated that manner in the communication of skiers , and I communicated with that approriate manner so that other players warmly welcomed me for a part of whole skiers .",warmly,22
1604,"However , stayed areas several days , I felt to needy of more practice of skiing , and there were no one could teach me how to improve .",,
1605,I already finished studying that I practiced before skiing .,,
1606,I finally decided to imitate an action of other matured players .,,
1607,That decision is a trial for me because I never practiced before at that way .,,
1608,My decision eventually well worked my skills of skiing .,,
1609,I was satisfied from both knowledge and trying new things .,,
1610,"It seems both ways are equally valued , though in fact it is not same value for me .",valued;value,6;15
1611,"While turned out results from both experiences are same , the method and the time that brings a result is not same .",,
1612,"Trial depended method for reaching success does not care about how long that the process consume a time , even sometimes trial method requires a longer time .",reaching;consume;requires,4;15;23
1613,I beleive the time has ultimate value in my life .,value,6
1614,"If both way can give me a primises of successful life , I choose the success is based on time saved method .",primises;based;saved,7;17;20
1615,"Therefore , I prefer to knowledge since knowledge save a time than the trying and taking risks actions do .",save,8
1616,Cars have been the means of transportation around the world for centuries .,,
1617,It is no doubt that the car is a major part of many peoples lives .,part,10
1618,So will there be fewer cars in use twenty years from now ?,,
1619,"Well , I think that the car will very much be present twenty years from now and probably with more users then ever , with a few changes to the car s functions and design of course .",,
1620,I think that the car will change greatly over a twenty year period .,,
1621,Resulting in a burst of popularity with many individuals around the world .,burst,3
1622,I think that many of the functions of the cars will be changed as well .,,
1623,"I think that the car , twenty years from now will use electric fuel not gasoline .",,
1624,I think this because there are many problems arising around the world regarding the price of gasoline .,,
1625,"Not only is the price of gasoline expensive but it is also destroying the atmosphere , resulting in global warming .",destroying,12
1626,"I feel that the car industry will thus , shift its vision on cars from gasoline to highly productive , well-made electric cars .",shift;its;vision,9;10;11
1627,"These electric cars will not only run on small amounts of electricity , but it will also have no exhaust pollution , creating a better and cleaner environment .",run,6
1628,It is because that I think these changes will occur that I say that the number of cars will not diminish in the future .,,
1629,I feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars will make people keep riding cars .,friendly;attachment,6;11
1630,I also think that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years because I think that many people in many societies are very attached to the car .,attached,24
1631,"It is not a mere transportation vehicle , but it is a part of tradition to drive a car in many countries .",,
1632,"For example , it is a tradition to get your drivers license when you turn the age of 16 in America .",,
1633,"Also it is a sign of wealth in many countries to own a car in many countries , such as China .",sign,4
1634,"Therefore , I feel that there will not be a decline in the use of cars because ; by losing the car you will lose many traditions , and traditions are a part of culture .",losing;lose,19;24
1635,So it is hard for me to think that the human race would diminish an entire part of culture from there lives within a short period of twenty years .,diminish;part,13;16
1636,"The attachment to cars by the human society and the possiblity to alter cars to better suit the needs of the environment and the people , make me conclude that the usage of cars will not decline in twenty years .",attachment,1
1637,I donotthink that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today by three reasons .,,
1638,Cars are expanded too much to cut off from our lives .,expanded;cut;off;from,2;6;7;8
1639,"As many people know , cars are very convenient and usefull machine .",,
1640,In Japan you can get a drivers lisence for no reasons except if your are older than 18 .,,
1641,Many people has a dream to drive a car especially if you are a male .,dream,4
1642,So it is impossible to say that you can not use a car for daily life .,,
1643,"In a several years , I think cars wonotuse a gasoline than now .",,
1644,It is true that cars are not good for environment .,,
1645,But many car companys are trying to make a new type of a car .,,
1646,"For example , bride car .",,
1647,"In the future , there may be a car that moves only by a electricities and not by gasoline .",,
1648,This can prevent a green-house effect .,green-house,4
1649,So there will be any reasons for not useing a car .,,
1650,"If you donotuse a car for transport , there should be a alternative transportation .",,
1651,Not useing a car means you have to use a different transportation to go somewhere .,,
1652,"In Japan trains are very common , but it is not so common to use a trains in other countries as in Japan .",,
1653,"For instant , America .",,
1654,These are my opnion for the statement .,,
1655,I disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do becasue the following reason .,,
1656,"To enjoy life , first thing we have to realize is how precious our lives are .",precious,12
1657,The life does not have to be a special one such as celebrities s or politician s .,,
1658,The normal life itself is already special enough .,,
1659,Without appriciate our lives we never really enjoy neither youth or life .,appriciate,1
1660,However there are many young people who seem to loose their interest in thier lives .,loose,9
1661,"Even though they are many things from they can take advantages , such as education for all children , development of computer systems , easy access to all around the world , availability of social supports and so on , they do not seem to be happy .",take;advantages;access,9;10;25
1662,They rather seem to take all advatages for granted or do not realize how lucky they are .,advatages,6
1663,One of the reasons why young people lost their will to live thier life more actively is that they are not able to picturelize how they would be in ten years later .,lost;picturelize,7;23
1664,"Becasue of bad economy , political mess , deceiving politicians , strange teachers etc .",mess,6
1665,it is not easy to keep their dreams and ambitions for children .,keep;dreams,5;7
1666,Instead they learn the word That s life or That s the way it is with a feeling of giving up .,,
1667,"So , those children grow up and become young adult who has no vision for the future .",vision,13
1668,"On the other hands , even though older people is loosing their physical abilities they still have will to live .",loosing;have,10;16
1669,Especially old people who have war-experience know how to appriciate what we have .,have;appriciate;have,4;9;12
1670,Life becomes enjoyable as long as people appriciate it .,appriciate,7
1671,"If life is simply to consume time , it could be awful time for waitng the ending .",consume,5
1672,Some people feel that it is more important for students to learn facts rather than to understand ideas and concepts .,,
1673,Such peole tend to think that learning facts can be the most effective way of increasing their knowlege in a variety of subjects .,,
1674,"In my opinion , however , for students , comphrehending ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .",,
1675,This essay will discuss two main reaons to support my opinion in more detail below .,support,8
1676,"First , I am definitely convinced that it is more important for studnets to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .",,
1677,"The reason is that by understanding ideas and concepts , students can improve their academic achievements more effectively .",,
1678,"In my exprience , for example , When I was in junior high school , I hated remembering a lot of formulas to solve math questions .",,
1679,"In the realm of mathematics , formulas mean facts .",,
1680,"However , When I took my math class from Mr Kimura for the first time at the age of 15 , I began to be good at math because he could teach me the concepts of formulas in very convincing ways .",,
1681,"That is , What I learned from his class is that in order to learn facts , understanding concepts or ideas which are strongly related to facts are indispensable to improve my academic achievement more quickly and effectively .",strongly,23
1682,"Second , I feel that it is more crucial for students to comprehend ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because understanding ideas and concepts can help students to improve their imagination and creativity .",,
1683,"For instance , in my personal experience , when I encounter unfamiliar words and phrases for my study of English , I always try to come up with the concepts of those words and phrases by myself before looking into my dictionary or referenced books , and I do believe that repeating this kind of practice day after day , I will be able to be skillful in my creativity and imagination .",encounter,10
1684,"All in all , I strongly believe that for students , understanding ideas and concepts more important than learning facts not only because they can promote their academic performance more effectively and quickly but also because understanding concepts and ideas can be beneficial for students to improve their imagination and creativity .",strongly;promote,5;25
1685,"well to start with I utterly disagree with such statement because I believe that a man s life resembles the different semesters of the year , in each lies beauty and happiness as well as problems and solutions .",semesters;of;the;year;lies,21;22;23;24;28
1686,"younger people are more motivated to start thier journey in life , they feel stronger and more motivated to prove themselves , they have different kinds of activities and interest .",start;journey,6;8
1687,"they are in the spring semester of their lives , where they are still green and growing fast .",spring;semester;green;growing;fast,4;5;14;16;17
1688,they have a vast majority of choices and a load of decisions to make .,vast;majority;load,3;4;9
1689,"while older people are more relaxed , they are in the autum semester of thier lives , they made thier minds about the most crucial things in life , they took decisions and they are handling life more maturely , they are less motivated , but more aware .",autum;semester;handling,11;12;35
1690,what am trying to do is to shed more light on the mentality and the status of people at different stages of thier lives although it doesn effect or interact with how much they enjoy their life .,shed;more;light;on;stages,7;8;9;10;20
1691,"But , in my opinion , what does effect the level of happiness , pleasure or enjoyment in life differs from one individual to another , it is totally related to ones perception of life and his prioreties and goals .",level;perception,10;32
1692,how much did i achieved till now ?,,
1693,what I want from life ?,,
1694,what I need in life ?,,
1695,do i have it ?,,
1696,we ask ourselves these questions all the time .,,
1697,"So , does young people enjoy life more that older people ? !",,
1698,Not really .,,
1699,To sum up must say that people enjoy life regardless of thier age .,,
1700,"Thus what does make the difference is not the age , it is the individual personality and its look towards life , its achievments and the level of sucess and failure .",look;level,18;26
1701,I donotthink it can be considered as a natural rule the fact that older people enjoy life less than young people do .,natural;rule,10;11
1702,"At the same time I must say that it is what generally happens , and for several reasons .",,
1703,"First of all , we live in a society I m specifically talking about the italian society in which the age a person decides to leave his family , for many reasons such as lack of job opportunity , lack of bravery and so on , is close to 30 .",bravery,41
1704,"This means that , until that age , young people donotface a lot of responsabilities they ll be obliged to face in the future .",face;face,12;22
1705,"Less responsabilities for young people means at the same time : a more available time for them , who generally use it to enjoy life ; b less available time , and more and more thoughts in consequence to their responsabilities , for the parents .",available;use;available,13;20;28
1706,This is the general scheme of a normal italian family s dynamic .,scheme;dynamic,4;11
1707,Fortunately it-s not always like that .,,
1708,My personal experience support me stating hat .,,
1709,"In fact I left my house when I was 18 and I came to live and study here in Milan , where I found a job and have my life without any dependence from anyone .",,
1710,"That allowed also my parents to spend the time they earned in some other activities , like having hobbies , or developing their personal interests .",spend;earned,6;10
1711,Enjoying their time .,,
1712,Enjoying their life .,,
1713,"Even if this is the most important reasons that brings me to affirm that young people generally enjoy their life more than older ones , there s a second that is just a physiological reason .",,
1714,"It is not difficult to understand that when we are young , we feel like we can climb mountains , traveling around the world without stops .",,
1715,"We are full of energies , our bodies are ready to face almost every kind of situation .",full;face,2;11
1716,"It is not the same thing for older people , who necessarily have to maintain a sort of proportion between their efforts and the forces they dispose of .",proportion;between;dispose,18;19;26
1717,A lot of things become forbidden just for physical reasons .,forbidden,5
1718,"But on the other hand , as I said before , older people can enjoy their life in a different way , proportioned to their possibilities , like traveling , or developing interests",proportioned,22
1719,To be successful you have to take risks and experiment new things !,experiment,9
1720,I definitely support this vision of life and there are many reasons why I believe so .,support;vision,2;4
1721,"First of all we should learn from history and from our recent past that many successful people tried innovative things , instead of continuing doing the usual , and their creativity and courage to take risks has been prized .",prized,38
1722,"For example , in many fields of art , from cinema to graphic design , from theater to painting , people who took risks to create and promote forms of art that were different and new and maybe even risky for the big public , are now on art history books and are considered as masters of contemporary art !",,
1723,A second reason why I strongly think that innovative things are a fundamental basis for success is that things that represent the norm or the usual have their own market and this market is very unlikely to increase when it has reached a very established and balanced steady state .,strongly;fundamental;basis;reached;balanced;steady,5;12;13;41;46;47
1724,But innovative things can open new markets from nothing !,open,4
1725,Think about the fast food industry in Italy in the was !,,
1726,"Before the was Italians were not used to fast food , the way it was intended in the United States .",,
1727,The first business man who decided to open the first hamburger fast food had to fight against the usual habit of Italian people to eat a simple panino sandwich in Italian or pizza .,fight,15
1728,"Sure the decision was risky , but 25 years down the line we have a McDonald s or a Burger King in any city center ...",down;the;line,9;10;11
1729,even adjacent to very important and beautiful historical buildings .,,
1730,"Maybe our landscapes have not benefited from it , but the owner of these chains had a great deal with his innovative entrepreneurial attitude .",,
1731,It can certainly be argued that for every positive and succesfull experience there are many others that donotreach the same goal of notoriety or economical success and risk is always a matter of chance !,reach,19
1732,"Nevertheless it is certainly true that , by not taking the risk of trying new things , success is very hard to obtain if one keeps doing the same and does not differentiate himself or herself from the rest of the people .",obtain,22
1733,I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .,,
1734,Usually teachers tend to show the answer to students when students do not know the answer because they may think that it is better for student to understand or is easy to teach for teachers .,,
1735,"However , students need an ability to understand idea and concepts .",,
1736,"Also , when they become a member of a society , it must be needed to state their opinion .",,
1737,There are some factors what is important for students .,,
1738,"Fist of all , Getting an ability to understand is more important than other skills .",Getting,4
1739,"For example , when students study about math , it will not good to students if teachers give the answer to them immidetaly because a skill of understanding or thinking is getting decrease .",give,17
1740,"I believe that when students think deeply about how they can solve the question , their brain work more activity and this action leads to the improvment of their brain .",deeply;leads;improvment,6;23;26
1741,"Second of all , Understanding ideas and concepts are more necessary than other learning in the business situation .",,
1742,"For instance , when you become a member of a society , you must give your opinion or are required your idea because most of companies need a person who are independent and have a good personality .",,
1743,"So , If you usually know the facts , you may not get understanding idea because , you usually think about it after you knew the answer .",,
1744,"Therefore , I believe that people often are needed understanding ideas and concepts in business situation .",,
1745,"In conclusion , I totally agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of getting skills and necessity in the business situation .",getting,28
1746,Most advertisements makes products seem much better than they realy are .,,
1747,"I totaly agree with this statement , most of advertisements give the consumers the advantages that they can get by using the products , and they try to avoid mentioning the disadvantages or the misuse or side-effects .",,
1748,"To give a life example of that statments , i will give an example from my personal field which is pharmacy .",,
1749,"Patients or Consumers in other words like most of medical companies prefer to address them , see the advertisements on TV , or newspaper .",,
1750,and easily get convinced with the mediation because of the following .,,
1751,"First , they use easy langauge and something most of us suffering from like pain , insomnia and symptoms of allergy , Second , they keep repeating the advertisement over and over agian .",,
1752,even some people get convinced that they have problem in sleeping although they donotand how the medication is effective and safe .,,
1753,"I know one of my patient , that she forced her physician to call me at the pharmacy to give me a phone - prescription for sleeping pills that she previously saw on TV .",forced,9
1754,"Although , she was not suffering from any sleeping problems just she liked the advertisement and the music on it and the color of the sleeping pill it was nice shiny pink color by the way and i say forced him becuase some could say he has the right to refuse .",forced,39
1755,he is a doctor .,,
1756,"yes , that is correct .",,
1757,but she mentioned that she will go to every single doctor other than him to prescribe the medication for her in case he will refuse to do so .,,
1758,and simply he does not want to lose bussiness .,lose,7
1759,"Third , The side-effects of the medication are written in small letters in the end of the advertisements or mentioned real fast that , the customers can not follow what was exactly said and the most important thing as i mentioned earlier .",follow,28
1760,"it has to be in the end of the advertisement , so no one can pay attention .",pay,15
1761,We can use the example that i just gave about the medications and the advertisement and thier ways on every single aspects and fields on advertisement bussiness .,,
1762,"To conclude and summarize , I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .",,
1763,for the previously mentioned reasons .,,
1764,Universities have considerably different educational systems .,,
1765,"Some focus on providing students with theoretical concepts and ideas , while other opted for practical learning methods .",focus;providing,1;3
1766,Both of these methods have advantages and I personally think that if a perfect educational system could exist then it should combine them .,,
1767,Theoretical concepts are necessary for students .,,
1768,"Indeed , they should help them to understand , model and simulate phenomena .",,
1769,"No doubt they may complicated and perhaps boring to study , but students should pay attention to them and check wether they get them correctly or not .",pay,14
1770,"Nevertheless , practical activities are also required in teaching activities .",,
1771,"In fact , they can help students to understand theoretical concepts .",,
1772,Students will more likely understand a phenomena by a short experiment rather than by a long and perhaps boring lecture .,,
1773,They would understand it even better indeed .,,
1774,Moreover students are generally more motivated to learn this way .,,
1775,In addition students understand better when they do thing by themselves through practical projects and so on .,,
1776,"In other words , they understand better what they discovered themselves than what they had been taught by others .",,
1777,"In my school , I had both theoretical teachings and practical teaching , and from my experiece I can say that combining these two methods in the right way is very fruitful for the students .",fruitful,31
1778,"For example , I have had in two industrial internship .",,
1779,From these experiences I learned a lot which I certainly could not have learned otherwise .,,
1780,"I learned about how thing work in a company , how workers behave to each other and",,
1781,I claim that most advertisement pushs much higher level than they really are .,pushs;higher;level,5;7;8
1782,"In these days , you can see ads everywhere around ; on a highway , on a street , in your living room , e.g.",,
1783,"TV , radio , computer .",,
1784,"We are surronded by so many ads , but how many of them did you really see or read or examine carefully ?",surronded,2
1785,Now you see many people are working professionally just for ad industry .,,
1786,Advertisements usually have much less information than the product really has .,,
1787,It used to be the case where there are tons of text on the poster or newspaper ads .,tons,9
1788,"However , some newspaper said out that people usually donotbother to read much text on ads because we are lazy and busy on everyday s life .",,
1789,Nowadays you can find dod .,,
1790,com adress for further detailed information for those who really interested .,,
1791,"Unfortunately , that can mean advertisements doesnothave to provide enough information on them .",,
1792,They can say only good things about the product .,,
1793,It is obvious that there are many professional firms just for advertisement .,,
1794,"They are really professional and they have been in business many years , so they know many techniques like how to attract people , how to entertain people by sound and cool cutting-edge computer graphic hollywood made visuals and so forth .",attract;cool;cutting-edge,21;31;32
1795,Who would like to make the product worse ?,,
1796,It is no doubt that they are working to try to make products look better in order to convince potencial customer to buy those products .,,
1797,"In fact , that may cause some troubles where they could provide untrue information .",,
1798,"As I wrote above , most advertisements are made by true professional creates and looking , sounding , entertaining really good .",,
1799,The thing is people have to be really careful about the information provided about many ads in these days .,,
1800,"Life is so diverse , that as much as a person learns throughout higher life , there is always more .",,
1801,"There does not exist a limit for learning , and new discoveries and creations pop up daily in our everyday news , growing in a parallel mode with the ever improving technology .",limit;pop;growing;parallel,5;14;22;25
1802,"As a matter of fact , a successful person is not one who knows a lot , but one who knows how , when and where to apply higher knowledge in the best way available .",,
1803,"A person who has mastered something X he does , is automatically better qualified to do and improve X than someone who has never seen or heard about it .",,
1804,Each human being has specific characteristics and environmental cultures that bound higher ability of the things he has learned .,bound,10
1805,"Sometimes , these limits are highly disadvantageous , yet they would not make this person specifically unsuccessful , because with the right knowledge at one specific task , he can sublime in a way even the best educated person on the globe could not .",limits,3
1806,"On the other hand , trying new things and taking new risks are very important in today s world , but it does not yet make it more successful a person who does it than one who does not .",,
1807,"In fact , innovations and risks should always be tried for newly developed ideas and for the person to improve higher skills and learn about most things a little .",,
1808,This concept is very well illustrated when compared to how the agricultural revolution evolved as an example .,illustrated;revolution;evolved,5;12;13
1809,"Imagine if a farmer would have to plant all types of fruits and vegetable , that at the end would barely be sufficient for his family survival in contrast to every one farmer specializing in a specific fruit or vegetable and than barter and trade with the others .",,
1810,"Like that , each one farmer would definitely profit more with the specialization , and as a result also consume the best quality goods altogether .",,
1811,"This shows that sometimes it is also beneficial to specialize in a specific ability to have the best results , because if everyone would like to do everything by himself the world would not go on .",go;on,34;35
1812,"Now again , this does not mean that having some overall knowledge would be harmful .",,
1813,"In conclusion , a successful person is a rather relative term .",,
1814,Because success can be attained with hard-work and loyalty to a goal .,loyalty,8
1815,"No matter the amount of risks and innovations taken , specializing yourself can be equally granted .",,
1816,"Have you ever imagined if professional athletes stopped playing basketball , football , or baseball , would they still be successful ?",,
1817,As people climb the ladder of success their ideas tend to change from dynamic and innovative to static and conservative .,climb;the;ladder;dynamic;static,2;3;4;13;17
1818,I believe that succesful poeple focus and doing what they already know how to do rather than exploring or trying out new things and taking risks .,focus;exploring,5;17
1819,"Reaching a level of success whether in bussiness or in life requires time and hard work , and upon reaching success risk would be to huge of a price .",Reaching;level;requires;reaching;price,0;2;11;19;28
1820,"For example , a bussiness man would prefer to keep-it-safe and insure his position rather than jeopardizing his whole career over a simple mistake .",keep-it-safe;insure;position,9;11;13
1821,"The same goes for trying out new things , because successful poeple are who they are due to the principles and polices that they have followed ; and for them to abandon such polices which lead them to success would be highly unlikely .",followed;abandon;lead,25;31;35
1822,Thus the latter would prefer to follow a path of conformity instead of radical change .,follow;a;path,6;7;8
1823,"Another important factor that renders successful poeple to aproach new things would be their mentality as in how the think in which they tend to rely on their past experiences as a measure for thier actions , while on the other hand fresh minds tend to graps new ideas faster and better thus striving to try out new things and build new experiences .",aproach;rely;measure;fresh;graps;build,8;25;32;42;46;60
1824,A typical example for a dynamic mind would be a fresh university graduate which is eager to learn and follow the path of success .,dynamic;fresh;follow;the;path,5;10;19;20;21
1825,"The ladder of success changes people in many ways , as they take the first step people are willing to take risks and try out new things ; but as their journey progresses they develope a new mentality which is built on past innovative , dynamic , and fruitful experiences thus paving the way for a more conservative and limited mentality .",ladder;first;step;journey;built;dynamic;fruitful;paving;the;way;limited,1;14;15;31;40;45;48;51;52;53;59
1826,"This question perfectly fits with my personal experience , in fact I had to face to this important question during my career as a student before and a worker after .",fits;face,3;14
1827,"At university I have studied political science , a faculty which gave me a wide knowledge other different subjects , such as politic , history , economy , languages , sociology , philosophy , mathematic , law , etc .",wide,14
1828,"During the period of my studies I have found them really usefull and not boring at all , because I could study different issues at the same time , making university a vary and always new method of learning .",,
1829,"The same day I had lessons of private law , mathematic and sociology , and this variety of subjects avoided the risk of getting tired of studing always the same thing .",risk,21
1830,"Then I graduated , and I had to face the incredible world of job .",face;world,8;11
1831,"And only at this point I have found out that all what I had studied at university gave me on one side a wide range of knowledges , but on the other a lack in the specific knowledge of one main subject .",wide,23
1832,"In all this , which knowledge is better ?",,
1833,The broad knowledge of many academic subjects or the specialization in one specific subject ?,broad,1
1834,"I still have to find myself the right answer , so that I have to arrange this lack giving a compromising answer : it s better to have a specialized knowledge in one subject which we like and on which we can focus our job and career , but we should optimize this specialization by widening as much as possible our basic knowledge of different subjects .",focus;optimize;widening,42;51;55
1835,"Another important factor concerns our goals : if our goal is to find a good and well attributed job , so we have to specialize in one subject because this is what is more needed and asked in the job s world .",world,41
1836,Nowadays there are more graduated with a good wide knowledge than graduated with a good specialization in one field of studies .,wide,8
1837,"On the other hand , if our goal is to have a general knowledge other different aspects which may help to understand one single sector of our life , such as for distance political science , we have to spend years other different academic subjects , studying a bit of everything .",sector;spend;bit,24;39;48
1838,I personally disagree with the statement that says that young people do not give enough time to their communities .,give,13
1839,I disagree with it because it is a very general statment and it is a typical stereotype and categorizing of young people .,,
1840,"In addition to that the statment is a non credible statement because it is obviously based on personal opinion rather than on facts , since it is not supported by statistics or any meaningful numbers .",based;on;supported,15;16;28
1841,The statment carries alot of hidden meaning or even insults to young people because it pictures them as selfish people who doesnotcare about their community .,carries;hidden;pictures,2;5;15
1842,"Not only that but it also indirectly indicates that young people are irresponsible people who do not positively contribut in their communities , and are not active members of their own community .",contribut;active,18;26
1843,"In addition to that , the statment that has been made against young people is a very general statment , since not all young people do not give enough time to their communities .",give,27
1844,"There are some young people who are addicted to charity work , and who dedicates a lot of their time in helping improve their community and in helping others .",addicted;dedicates,7;14
1845,Thus we canotgeneralize .,,
1846,"I also disagree with such a statement because i personally think that it is a weak statment becaue it is not supported by any kind of eveidence such as a survey , statistics , or any meaning full numbers .",weak;supported,15;21
1847,To me this statement is just like throwing accusations on others .,throwing;on,7;9
1848,such statments are not acceptable to me not only because i disagree witth this particular statment but because if i accepted such stereotypes it means that i might as well accept other stereotypes .,,
1849,"And by doing that i ll be encouraging stereotypes that might be more serious or even dangerous and that might seriously affect our society , community , or even the way or even the quality of our living .",serious;dangerous,13;16
1850,"Everyone in this life like to be a successful person , but it is not easy to be a successful .",,
1851,To be a successful persons you should have many charicristic that it could help you .,,
1852,And I agree that the person who wants to be successes he should be a risky person and should not be worried about some easy thing that could be solved .,,
1853,I agree with this for reasons .,,
1854,"firstly , if the persons stood and waited for people to do every thing for him , he would not be a successful persons .",stood,5
1855,"There are alot of people who are like that , I will give an example of many people that I can see them in my daily life .",,
1856,"The example is that one of my best friend who wants to be a successful Medical Doctor , he is eighteen years old and he has only one problem that is facing him and this problem is haveing a good grade in TOEFL to be accept in the university , even this is his only problem , he is not working and practicing to have the wanted grade .",facing,31
1857,"The second reasons that make me agree with this statement is the richest man in the world , the microsoft owner .",,
1858,He put an imposible goal that could be reached .,put;reached,1;8
1859,"He put a risky goal to work on it , 30 years ago the put .",put;put,1;14
1860,"His goal was to make every house in the world haveing a computer , and he successes in his goal .",,
1861,How did he success ?,,
1862,"It was not an easy goal , he start his dream with his friend by having a small company that make a computer softer .",dream,10
1863,He was thinking what is the helpful computer programms that could the humanity to be better .,,
1864,"And he could to reach his goal to have a computer in every house in the world , beacuse of it is great programms , like the internet explorer that make the conection between all the people in the world very easy and make them feeling that the world is a small village .",reach;conection;small;village,4;32;51;52
1865,I agree the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide .,,
1866,"Last summer i went to Itlay with a group and a tour guide , I liked my trip becuse I meet new people form diffrent places and shier same informations .",shier,27
1867,If I did not with the guide I would miss many places in Italy .,miss,9
1868,"In the same time , I did not konw the history for the places i had visit .",,
1869,"Two years ago , I went to Japan with my friend , most of the time we were lost because , we did not speak thier language and did not know thier transportion system .",,
1870,Travel with the group and the tour guide is cheer than trade alone and you cane see more places in limited time .,limited,20
1871,"In addition , some trade agents have many tours so , you can select what you like .",,
1872,"However , they have programs during the trip to make the travels enjoy they trip .",,
1873,"There is bad thing when travel with group , some people do not respect the others and make the travelers do not like the trip .",,
1874,But in genral I prefer travel with group and a tour guide .,,
1875,"Yes , I agree with the statement represented by this short phrase .",,
1876,"This statement cites two important aspects of the learning phase that a student faces when studying : first of all memorizing facts , and last but not latter , extract from facts the concepts and the ideas behind them .",phase;faces;extract;behind,9;13;29;37
1877,"Both are important in the learning process , that can not be accomplished fully without each of them : they are like two sides of the same coin .",fully;two;sides;of;the;same;coin,13;22;23;24;25;26;27
1878,"Although that , one of them is more important than the other .",,
1879,"The statement means that students must not stop working and thinking when they have acquired the information presented by books or lectures , but they must go over , and gain a deeper comprehension on what they have memorized .",acquired;go;over;gain;deeper,14;26;27;30;32
1880,"I think that , when we start learning something new , its useful to begin from facts , that may be easy to remember and useful for fixing important data .",fixing,27
1881,"So , we gain a fist impression , or a whole image of the topic , useful for further analysis .",gain;impression;image,3;6;11
1882,"Next , we must go on , because learning isnotonly that : the student must pay attention on the concept behind the facts and data he has learned .",go;on;pay;behind,4;5;17;22
1883,"That data give us a background that must be used for building a deeper knowledge , that require each of us a harder personal work .",background;building;deeper,5;11;13
1884,"Only in that way we can obtain a more abstract idea of the field of human knowledge he is studing , and obtain a general view on the topic , broader than the one depicted by the facts he meet in the beginning .",obtain;obtain;view;broader;depicted;meet,6;22;25;30;34;39
1885,"Attending a reading in a class , adn interact with professors and other students can stimulate thi process , and I think that after this work has been ruled out , it became easier to remember the concepts : basing our knowledge only on facts , readings , and so on that where memorized can be an error , because in the long term our memory might not be good as in youth , and the hard work we have done can became",basing;on,39;43
1886,I think that travel with few people and without a tour guide is the best way to enjoy your trip .,,
1887,"I believe that a tour guide is necessary just if you plan to visit a country whose culture , habbits or language are really difficult to understand .",habbits,19
1888,I consider that the people you travel with are the most important issue when you plan a journey .,,
1889,"Together with my wife , we once went to Mexico with two friends of us who had never traveled before .",,
1890,We invited them to come with us and we contracted a local tour guide even if we both speaks spanish .,,
1891,"We realized , after few days , that it was a bad idea .",,
1892,"As our friends were not used to the Mexican high temperatures , they got sick after visiting the Chichenitza archeological site .",,
1893,During the following days we visited the south part of the country and we realized that the tour guide was explaining us the same things that we would have found written in a tourist book .,,
1894,Considering this bad experience we decided to organize our next travel by ourself .,,
1895,Next summer we are going to Japan were my wife spent a whole year learning Japanes during an international exchange program .,spent,10
1896,"This time , instead of contracting a tour guide , we are going to ask to the people she met there , to give us a tour around the country .",give,23
1897,We will visit the most famous Japanes places with local people and we will be able to schedule our journey without depending on the group s plans .,,
1898,"Advertisements or branding is an important key in today world of business , in fact , it become very essential in selling any product or item .",key,6
1899,Most marketting organizations or companies relay on branding or advertisements to introduce their products to the market .,relay,5
1900,Most people are looking for brands through advertisements .,,
1901,Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .,,
1902,In my opinion I think that this statement is completely true .,,
1903,"Although advertisements gave the customers very valuable information about the product he or she intend to buy , but that is not neccessary to give him the full information he need and not to be necessary ture 100 percent for many reasons : Firstly , the advertisement will be prepared by a specialized staff or expert who is professionally prepared to attact customers to buy their products .",gave;give;full;attact,2;24;27;61
1904,"In other word it is matter of money first of all , but not necessary quality .",,
1905,There is no guarantee about efficiency or quality of the product unless it is very big company where brand name means a lot to that specific company .,means,20
1906,"Secondly , By using new advanced technological methods available today for photography , digital imaging and printing high technology , the marketing company can send strong message to customers , but that not nessessaryily will give them full details about the brand or product .",send;strong;message;give;full,24;25;26;35;37
1907,"From my personal experience , I think it is matter of trust and loyalty to a specific company .",,
1908,"Long time ago , I have received some advertisement by mail about new type of shoes .",,
1909,The company pretends in their advertisement that their shoes will be practical at all seasons and it will stay for long time and the photo included in that advertisement was very impressive .,,
1910,I was convinced at that time and I have decided to buy that shoes .,,
1911,"It comes to my surprise when I have received my order , that type of shoes which I was waiting for is not what I am looking for .",,
1912,It was just normal rubber shoes and it dies not stay for long as they have said .,,
1913,"Of course I get dissoponited In conclusion , I would like to declare that branding or advertisement is as necessary tools in marketing but also make products much better than they really are , especially by using high advanced technology available today .",tools,20
1914,Knowing little about many things or knowing more about less things is a question that we face many times in our life .,face,16
1915,The explosion of knowledge in increasing number of knowledge fields make this question more provocative .,explosion,1
1916,I think that answering this question is affected by expected gains of each answer as well as the personality of the individual to answer .,,
1917,The life experience and career of a person can support one answer and undermine the other answer .,,
1918,Speciality is a relative concept in this case .,,
1919,Any career needs a certain degree of specially in these days .,,
1920,"You can not go to any field without having the necessary knowledge and skills , as well as attitudes , that compromise such field .",,
1921,I think that the question is related to the level of specially that one needs .,,
1922,In other words how deep we need to go in the field of specially .,deep,4
1923,"Another level of the issue is about wether this will isolte us from other fields , i .e ignoring horizontal knowledge .",isolte;horizontal,10;19
1924,"As a social worker , I think it is more empowering for me in my work and life to be of broad knowledge .",broad,21
1925,Having broad knowledge will facility my communication with different types of clients .,broad,1
1926,When the client feels yuo share with him or her a language he or she will build trust and feel nearer to you .,build;nearer,16;20
1927,Another reason for that stems from the ability of understanding the environment of the case that may include different types of knowledge .,stems,4
1928,This will save you from going every time to somebody to help you .,save;from,2;4
1929,Another point that makes me oppose ignoring broad knowledge for the sake of more specializing is related to the personality of an individual .,broad,7
1930,I think people who like to grow vertically in knowlege ignoring horizontal growth will end up socially isolated wether they like or not .,grow;vertically;horizontal;growth;isolated,6;7;11;12;17
1931,"In general , I am with reasonable richness in horizontal knowledge",richness;horizontal;knowledge,7;9;10
1932,"I am 25 years old , so my personal experience only covers half of the statement , the part regarding young people ; however i can look at my relatives or at other elder people to infer something about how do thay enjoy life .",covers,11
1933,"In a first approximation , I think that each one enjoy his her life in a different way , so it is not easy to generalize this evaluation distinguishing between younger and older people .",,
1934,"However , I have to point out that a necessary even not sufficient condition for a person to enjoy his her life is to have a good health ; and it is statistically true that older people have more chances to have a bad health Apart from this first consideration , there are some other matter of facts about how youngers and olders conduct their lifes .",have;have;conduct,24;41;63
1935,"In fact , a very important consideration has to be done about work .",,
1936,"Younger people have to work harder than the olders that often are on retirement , so the younger have less time to spend for their own enjoyment and , depending on the retirement system , they can also have less money ! .",have;less;spend,18;19;22
1937,"Nonetheless , young people have more opportunities to have fun because most of entertainment better fits to them such as discos , some kinds of sport activities , some kinds of concerts or travels , etc ..",have;have;fits,4;8;15
1938,"The negative aspect connected with this wider range of opportunities is that sometimes young people suffer of a kind of anxiety of having fun and doing lots of things , which ends to make them always unhappy with what they are doing .",wider;suffer;having,6;15;22
1939,"In fact , it is true that maybe older people have a different way of approaching to life that allows them to get the best from every situation and to enjoy more of simple things .",approaching;get;simple,15;22;33
1940,"This different way of appreciating things perhaps derives from their maturity , their whole experience and make their lifes more relaxed and sometimes more serene .",derives;whole,7;13
1941,"In conclusion , I think that it is not possible to completely agree or disagree with the statement because it depends on individual attitudes and external conditions how a person can enjoy his her life during different periods .",,
1942,Once more I see that life is more complicated and people are more different one to another than it can be described in a short phrase .,,
1943,Excellent statement : why ?,,
1944,Because I think that this phrase is the question that lots of us ask to oneself .,,
1945,"For me is difficult analyze it , but I will try to explain my idea .",,
1946,"Imagine in your mind this : on the right hand you have young people , I have supposed that young could be until forty years old , on the opposite hand you have old people .",,
1947,My idea is that for the fist part of people is simpler find something to do in general to enjoy their life than for the second part .,,
1948,"The reasons are that when you are young I always suppose you have much energy to dicover something new , for example new sports , new interests , new passions or new works to do .",have;dicover;passions,12;16;29
1949,All these reasons were used by old people when they were young and this for me can be another reason because the old people enjoy their life less then young .,,
1950,"If I could get in old people mind I think that I would start to look me around and I would think : I have worked all life , I have studied all life and now I am pretty tired .",get;in,3;4
1951,"With my mind is difficult think that in the future I will spend all my time to do nothing , maybe because I will not be able to what I would like to do , but this because I am young , because I want to discover new part of wolrd that I have not seen again , because I love sport and I think that I could not live without it , because I want to increase my knowledge and because I have to start to work .",spend;discover,12;46
1952,"For all these reasons I understand the old people that they cannnot what they do , I think that it would be difficult to organize the life when you are old .",,
1953,"However , I think that it is possible , because I have a personal example : my grandfather ; for him every morning is a new day to discover .",discover,28
1954,"How many times did we buy a product after been delighted by its amazing beauty or features and then , we found out that it was really useless , with our great disappointment ?",,
1955,"As a matter of fact advertising doesnotshow the customer the downsides of its product or service , but emphasizes the essential advantages that it can bring into our lifes .",downsides;bring,12;27
1956,"If we go deeper into the topic , analyzing how people develop commercials and advertisements , we can identify why this can happen .",deeper,3
1957,"First it s analyzed the ideal customer and , according to higher tastes and preferences , some characteristics , or even emotions , are underlined in the advertisements .",underlined,24
1958,"Furthermore some technical devices are used to create the sensation of wealth in the consumer , for instance using the image of a creamy yoghurt , surrounded by fresh fruits and pieces of chocolate , even if , in the reality - practically making the commercials - the yoghurt is just a white-colored cream , so creamy that it s impossible to recreate into reality .",,
1959,"In addition the advertisements can use the technique of the association to something else , even something that is completely different but that must share the same feeling of the advertized product .",,
1960,"For example Gillette , a famous brand of razors , made an advertisement for its product placing , on a page of a magazine , the shape of the razor , close to a Ferrari , a sportif and expensive car .",,
1961,The two shapes had the same bright colors in order to underline their hypothetical similarity regarding the strong sensations they could offer towards the consumer .,underline;strong;offer,11;17;21
1962,"All this arguments are presented in order to emphasize some features that we feel , watching advertisements , and make products much better than they really are .",,
1963,"I believe that people who are successful try a lot of new things even though they have high risks for the following reasons ; changing time , improve themselves , and enjoying themselves .",,
1964,"First of all , time must be changing .",,
1965,Our life style are changing with time change .,,
1966,"For example , people who lived in sixteen century did not use cars .",,
1967,"Their transportation was horse , caws , and so on .",,
1968,"However , now , we can not live without cars , especially in the United States .",,
1969,"A person , who made car at first , may be successful , and made us more convenience to live .",,
1970,One idea can change our life .,,
1971,"Second , when we are trying a new things , we can learn how to endure without conciousness .",endure,15
1972,"When we learn new things , we need a lot of knowledge , information , and results of tests .",,
1973,It will take a long time .,take,2
1974,"I respect to Mendel , who identified the existance of DNA in with century .",,
1975,He tried mating peas again and again .,,
1976,"Finally , trying new things make ourselves happy .",,
1977,"In my opinion , people who do not have curiosity are like old-men .",old-men,12
1978,"For example , I am very interested in Science , especially Biochemistry .",,
1979,"When I study it , I am excited and I enjoy studying it .",,
1980,"When I get good score on tests , I am very glad to study it hard .",,
1981,"In addition , I can understand what happened I , environment , and earth thorough the science aknowledgements .",,
1982,"In my childhood , I was not interested in Science ; however , after I came the United States , I took chemistry class , my mind was opened .",opened,28
1983,I felt that I could do anything I want to do .,,
1984,"Therefore , I can enjoy my life , now .",,
1985,"In conclusion , I think people do not have to worry about risks of trying new things .",,
1986,Trying new things will make them more optimistic and give a lot of confidence to them .,give,9
1987,In this article I will discuss the advantages and the drawbacks of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects with respect to specializing in one specific subject .,broad,13
1988,I think that both of them are required today for a successful career .,,
1989,The rest of this work is organized as follows .,,
1990,"Firstly , I will analyze the main issues about studying many subjects .",,
1991,Then I will focus on the problems related to specialization .,focus,3
1992,"If you decide to study many subjects , you will be prepared for a wide range of jobs .",wide,14
1993,However there are also some drawbacks .,,
1994,First of all it is hard to follow too many academic courses on completely different topics .,follow,7
1995,Moreover some jobs required an high level of specialization and in this case it is better to have little and good knowledge that many and poor skills .,,
1996,"Instead if you are specialized in one specific subject , you could find a well paid job because few people have a background focused on one particular field .",focused,23
1997,"On the other hand , if your highly specialized skills are not needed by the market , it will be very challenging to find a new job and you will have to start studying again .",,
1998,"This time , however , you will probably choose something more general .",,
1999,This prospective could be awful if it happens when you are too old and have a family .,,
2000,In conclusion I think the best solution is something between the two choices .,between,9
2001,One should have broad knowledge of a general field but also should be specialized in a particular subject of this field .,broad,3
2002,Mostly there is two kinds of people .,,
2003,one is trying to do new things and takes risks .,,
2004,"on the there hand , people like to do only thing they know it before without takeing any risky things .",,
2005,Each kind of these people have their reasons .,,
2006,I will discuss more about them in this assay .,,
2007,"First of all , people who like to do new things and to involve in risky things , i will call it a risky man .",,
2008,This man have the feel of challenge .,,
2009,"There fore , he likes to do risky and strange things and he enjoy it .",,
2010,"For instance , a man who like to claim mountains , sailing a round the world or , for more risky , swiming from country to others .",,
2011,why do the risky man do this things ?,,
2012,Properly he want to grant a huge number of money and to be a famous and unforgitable .,,
2013,"Further more , most of these people you can find them in dinner record .",,
2014,"Secondly , people who like to do normal and usual things , i can call them a calmy man .",,
2015,This man like to live in peaceful and calm life .,calm,8
2016,He prefer to have a happy family than making risky things .,,
2017,"plus , he think that person who do a risky things is craizy .",craizy,12
2018,"More over , this calmy man usually have a job with loving partners .",,
2019,"how ever , he rarely go on trails and trips .",,
2020,"Finally , i think being a risky man it is not good due to the risky situations that he faces during his life .",faces,19
2021,"Also , being a calmy man is not good too .",,
2022,His life is very quite and boring .,,
2023,In my opion is that combining between the two personality is better .,,
2024,So then from time to another you can make little risky and new things like saying about or building a wooden house .,,
2025,"More over , having a nice family with a good job .",,
2026,Transportation and Crowded There is a huge number of cars and trunks nowdays .,,
2027,Big number of him are for transportation .,,
2028,Is that huge number going to be reduced or increased in future ?,,
2029,That is very important question to ask ourselves and think deeply on this important issue .,deeply,10
2030,My own opinion is the number of cars are going to increase rapidly .,,
2031,There are alot of ways to go and back in or out cities because there are more and more ways of transportation are discoverd .,discoverd,23
2032,Cars are the first modern kind of way we use for long time .,,
2033,"Now , we have another useful transportation as trains , buses and taxies .",,
2034,"For example , we dont have these other kinds of transportations in Saudi Arabia , and we are suffuring from the crowded evry single day .",suffuring,18
2035,Other factor helps in decreasing number of cars used evry day is cars prices .,,
2036,It is increasing day than the other .,,
2037,It could cost you an arm and leg to buy a car these days .,arm;and;leg,5;6;7
2038,"Cars maker are chalinging each other not only in the quality , but also in the price .",chalinging,3

2045,"Some marketing practicationers have defended the idea that marketing and , in particular , advertisement keep playing a neutral role in the modern society by only promoting the features of a product .",defended;neutral,4;18
2046,"On the contrary , among academics and most of the public opinion , this claim has completely been rejected .",,
2047,In my opinion this second position best highlights what the actual situation really is : Products are overpushed through the advertisment channels by mistelling what they really value for the final customer .,highlights;overpushed;through;channels,7;17;18;21
2048,Ever more commercials promise customers greater benefit from their products misleading the real wants and needs of them .,misleading,10
2049,Modern advertisment are able to manipulate the customer will and often convince higher to buy products not really wanted .,,
2050,It may also happen that the features illustrated by the commercial are really disappointing to the customer when this experience the product .,,
2051,"Furthermore , by lying to the customer through advertisment , the firm can really harm the final consumer .",,
2052,This is the case of those kind of products that cause accident to the user .,,
2053,These products tend to overestimate the capacity of certain features exposing the customer to danger .,,
2054,"Since , I think , this issue is tremendously current , more attention should be given to it .",given,15

2080,"I believe that specializing in one subject is better and more important in the world we live in today , than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .",broad,22
2081,Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be very good socially since it allows the person to communicate with people on many subjects .,broad,1
2082,"However it is not enough in the society that we live in today , since you can not have a decent job if you merely have broad knowledge of things .",broad,26
2083,Jobs require specific and thorough knowledge of a specific subject or subjects .,,
2084,Working as a lawyer for example requires thorough and indepth knowledge of the law and general knowledge would not be enough to become a lawyer .,indepth,9
2085,Specializing in one subject means that that person is going to become really good at that subject and that therefore he may pursue it in the future .,pursue,22
2086,This ensures that this person will be able to find a job in our now very specialized world .,,
2087,"Someone who specializes in finance , for example , may work at a bank and then from there he can learn about many other things , which help in everyday life , and he can gain knowledge from having a job .",,
2088,Therefore specialization leads to broader knowledge in other subjects .,leads;broader,2;4
2089,"Specialization , as it was discovered and agreed upon by most economists including the father of economics , Adam Smith , leads to greater efficiency .",,
2090,This is because someone who specializes in something and does it all the time discovers ways to improve upon it and therefore becomes an expert in that field .,,
2091,This has led to an increase in the specialisation of the workplace and jobs .,led,2
2092,That is way anyone who wishes to succeed in life and have a job needs to specialize in something .,,

2110,"When studying , and in life in general , it is important to comprehend rather than using the memory to repeat words or facts that eventually will not have sense in the near future .",,
2111,Facts are still important and should not be forgotten .,,

2123,That is what i usually get when i am really bored of studing or tired of endless working hours while my grandfather or even my father are getting ready to go on some sort of selfpleasing activity .,endless,16
2124,I believe old people enjoy life more than youth or even teenagers do with all the study and work hours or the restrictions forced by parents .,restrictions;forced,22;23
2125,It is so hard for a young family member to enjoy life as much as elders do .,,
2126,"As a begining , old people dont have any kind of study , midterms or finals to care about .",,
2127,"They dont have to spend hours studing , going to school , attending classes or even buying books .",spend,4
2128,They have alot of free time they can spend in any selfpleasing activity that brings happiness and joy to them .,have;spend;brings,1;8;14
2129,In addition to that most of old people do not have a job or a career to care about .,,
2130,Most of them are either business owners or unemployed at all which is even better they have nothing to distract them from having fun .,distract,19
2131,Not like young people who spends between forty and fifty hours each week at work .,spends,5
2132,They have much more time to enjoy it .,have,1
2133,"Also , financial wise young people have alot of bills and payments .",,
2134,"After school fees , rent and maybe car morgage their is not enough money left to spend for fun or enjoyment .",,

2139,"When people plane travel some of them prefer to travel in agroup led by a tout guide , while some of them prefer to travel individually .",,
2140,In my opinion the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .,,
2141,"First when you travel in a group led by a tour guide , you will not take the risk and the tour guide will help in lot of things .",take,16
2142,of course the tour guide will be an expert person knowing his or her job very well .,,
2143,So there will clear day by day program .,clear,3
2144,"The tour guide will know the area , which to be visited , very well .",,
2145,"He or she know where the historical places in the area , the parks , the resturants , and all the important places around the area .",,
2146,Even the tour guide know where are the goverment offices and hospital in case of any emergency .,,
2147,All this will let the traveler to relax and enjoy his time and not to concentrate on the details of the trip and avoid the hassle .,relax;avoid;hassle,7;23;25
2148,Second when you travel in a group led by a tour guide it will be golden opportunity to know different people from different places and this may led to make friendship and as there is tour guide there is more time for this kind of relationship .,golden,15
2149,Even these friendship can continue after the trip through the e .,,
2150,mails and the phones conversations .,,
2151,These kind of trip some times could be a chance for some people to find their life partner .,,
2152,Last by traveling in a group always you will find some people with you durring the bad times and durring the good times and it will be a chance to help people as been help by other peop Upon all the above poins traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel in my opinon,,

2155,"While this may be true for some individuals , there is an increasing number of young people devoting their time to help their communities and other communities which need support .",devoting;support,17;29
2156,I have observed young students sacrificing their summer holidays to help build houses and volunteer in poor African communities .,sacrificing,5
2157,"Yet have also observed other young people self involved in their day to day life not helping their community either because they do not care or they simply do not have the time as they have other priorities play with their friends , go to camp , etc ..",have,30
2158,The broader issue is around education and what young people are being taught in the classroom and at home .,broader,1
2159,Many homes do not lead by example or embed the sence of community or sharing in the education of their children .,lead;by;example;embed,4;5;6;8

2161,"There are indeed some young people who support their communities , however the support is not sufficient with the growing world problems we are seeing nowadays .",support;support;growing,7;13;19
2162,I therefore agree with the statement as not sufficient support is available .,support,9
2163,Young people with energy can provide a lot of help to their communities by allocating very little time of their day .,provide;allocating,5;14
2164,"For example , teaching a child of the community how to read or write , helping an old person with tasks they are not capable of doing , support in the building of a new school or hospital , etc .",support,28
2165,"Many people associate help with spending money , while that may sometimes be the case , helping ones community with ones personal time could be equally rewarding .",rewarding,26
2166,Helping ones community does not always have to be financial .,,

2170,"There will always be more problems in this continent than helping hand , however , we can start by increasing the help to our communities and do the best we can to improve the lives of the communities we live in .",hand,11
2171,"Regarding the statement , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , I agree with this idea .",,
2172,There are a couple of reasons .,,
2173,Doing only what they already know how to do well in the life could not make any creating thinking and ideas and could not reach any good chance to go up more higher status of their positoin or money and more exciting .,reach;go;up;higher;positoin,24;29;30;32;36
2174,The decision and carefull thinking and consideration for feasibility and risk taking analysis to do new things will be crucial .,,

2194,I personally traveled a lot in my life because i think its one of the best way to learn about diversities and cultures .,,
2195,Since i was born my parents would often take me and my brother on vacation .,,
2196,"I consider my self lucky because i had the opportunity to visit country such as Venezuela , India , Canada , Brazil and many others .",,
2197,Well none of these travels were guided by group led .,,
2198,"From what i know a tour guide job concern whit showing to tourists the beauties or something in particular of a certain country , and i am sure that they do their job in the right way .",,
2199,"But i think that one of the most fascinating and interesting thing when you are visiting a new country , i would call it the taste of your vacation , come from your desire to discover the same beauties by your own .",taste,25
2200,"When i visit a new country a what to feel all the tradition and culture that characterize it , i want to become , during that period , part of what is going on .",feel;part,9;28
2201,"For example while i was in India i ve been invited to a traditional Buddist wedding ; at the beggining i was a bit suspicious , i was not sure to ware their traditional wedding dress , it was a large pair of pants full of different colors .",,
2202,At the end i decided to ware it and still now after five years i remember that day as one of the most emotionally intense day of my life .,intense,24
2203,In all my trip arround the world i ve been in many situation that gave me lots of satisfaction and i am sure that i wouldnotfeel in the same way if was a guide who took me to that wedding .,,
2204,"To end my paper i want to dear my aversion to tour guide vacation , you spend more and enjoy less .",,
2205,I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .,,
2206,Because the idea seems to be too shallow and narrow to me .,shallow;narrow,7;9
2207,"I would rather say it depends on each individual whether they can enjoy life or not , than just generalize them by their age .",,
2208,I am going to state examples to support the idea .,,
2209,"Firstly , there has been increasing number of young people , who do not have clear purpose of the life , being at a loss what to do .",clear;at;a;loss,15;22;23;24
2210,"These kind of people often do not even work , which naturally means that they do not have enough opportunity to show their ability .",,
2211,That kind of life seems to be very boring and meaningless to me .,meaningless,10
2212,"Although some people might enjoy their moment of the life by doing something funny and stimulus , my impression for that is they are just having fun temporary .",having,25
2213,I think it does not mean that they fully enjoy thier life .,fully,8
2214,"As long as there are many young people living without a obvious purpose or destination , I think it can not be said that all young people enjoy their life .",destination,14
2215,"Secondly , let me introduce my own experience about my grand mother .",,
2216,"She lives alone after her husband died , but she is so energetic and vigorous , and seems to enjoy her life very much .",,
2217,"That is probably because she has a lot of friends around her , who usually drop by to chat with her .",has;drop;by,5;15;16
2218,I think being needed by others gives people will of life .,gives,6
2219,"Lately , she even started singing with her friend in Karaoke , and is now putting much enthusiasm in it .",putting;in,15;18
2220,"By seeing my grand mother , I was well convinced that older people can live their life with many enjoyments .",,
2221,That is the reasons I think given statement is too superficial .,superficial,10
2222,"Even Young people could feel their life meaninngless and boring , while there is enough chance for older people to fully enjoy their life .",meaninngless;fully,7;20
2223,It is all up to theirselves .,,

2225,if you have specific knowledge you are limited .,limited,7
2226,in the world of the work if you have specific knowledge you will have more difficult to find a job than a person who have broadn knowledge .,world;broadn,2;25

2228,well i think that for the person is more beautiful have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because if you have more knowledge you can speak with any people you meet .,broad,11
2229,you could speak with various type of people .,,
2230,people who have different trucks of life .,trucks,4
2231,people who arrive to various places of the world and speak different languages .,,
2232,if you have specialize knowledge in one specific subject you may not understand other different subject very well because you donothave basic knowledge of other subject .,,
2233,in the past there wasnotthe possibility to know many sub,,

2235,"The media has played very important role is misleading people , and made people to believe in what is not true however there are always exceptions .",misleading,8
2236,The media industry has been playing with people trust in order to sell the products of diffrent companies because they pay alot to make attractive advertisements .,playing,5
2237,To verify my point i am going to give few examples .,,
2238,For instance i bought a washing liquid after seeing it on the tv the products gives you guarantee that it will take away all the marks no matter how deep they are but after using the product i was not satisfied .,deep,29
2239,Infact it was just waste of my money and time .,waste,4
2240,"I have a rough estimation that 8 out of 10 products are not reliable , after my past experiences .",,
2241,"Alot of things play a role in making the product so appealing , a high budget advertisement even take well know celeberties to emphasis the quality of the product and to some extent we all believe the well known figure and we might again mislead ourselves .",appealing;mislead,11;44
2242,"You may see alot of commercial on the weekends which compel you to buy the products which you really donotneed , you just get impressed by the commercial and later on after using it you realize it doesnot benefit you as the comercial shows .",compel,10
2243,"Another example i bought a shirt from mall after seeing the model wearing it , when i wore the shirt it nothing felt or looked like the model has promised .",,
2244,"The light , the makeup and the setup made it appear far better than the quality and even the look of the shirt .",,
2245,"I do believe that there are few products from well known companies which have developed trust over time but mostly the others are all not at all satisfying and are just waste of money and time , they play with ones feelings .",developed;waste;play,14;31;38
2246,The better the advertisement the better money the company has paid to make the advertisement to the reality itself .,,
2247,I do agree with the opinion expressed in the statement .,,
2248,In every day life is it possible to hear statements like that .,,
2249,"Simple statements not deriving for philosophical thoughts , just simple expressions of every day life s observation .",deriving,3
2250,I think that is possible to explain such a cliche giving some examples that truly confirm the point .,,
2251,Young people have more time than adults to enjoy their life .,have,2
2252,Usually young people go to school and have the opportunity to meet people of their age .,have,7
2253,"Sharing school-time make young people eager to play sports together , to go out at night together and enjoy life .",,
2254,"Adults usually have to think of their families , they usually work to earn the money necessary to feed their children and so they have less time to do what they want .",have;less,24;25
2255,Adults actually do not have time to enjoy life .,have,4
2256,Even if the adult is a rich person he has not the possibility to organize his life independently of his or her responsabilities .,has,9
2257,As you become older you have more to accomplish in order to respect what people expect from you .,,
2258,What I have just written could be contrasted affirming that young people enjoy life because they do not know what life is .,,
2259,Young people can not see the hidden difficulties that everyone experiences in his life .,see;hidden,4;6
2260,But we all know that sometimes is good not to know everything .,,
2261,"I could give also a personal example , when I was Child life seemed easy to me , I thought that could become everybody I wanted to , but now I know that real life is different .",,
2262,"To reach want you want to reach you need to forget sometimes friends , sports , and all other things that could help enjoying life .",reach;reach;forget,1;6;10
2263,"As we all know , It is necessary for an adult person to find in his accomplishments and in his work the sources of life enjoyment .",find;sources,13;22

2267,Some people think that studying facts is more important than studying ideas and concepts .,,

2270,I will explain reasons to support my view .,support;view,5;7
2271,Ideas and concepts is helpful for students to understand facts .,,

2276,"Secondly , using ideas and concepts , individuals can develop ideas and extend their view of points .",extend;view,12;14
2277,"In short , ideas and concepts should be learned first .",,
2278,Learning ideas and concepts enable students to solve problem quickly .,,
2279,"First of all , students can think issues logically because ideas and concepts make problems easier to understand .",,
2280,"Secondly , students learn skills effectively .",,
2281,"For instance , to learn language , such as English , students need to learn grammer and structure .",,
2282,Only listening native speaker s conversations is not enough to master English .,master,10
2283,"In brief , ideas and concepts is useful for students .",useful,7
2284,"Of course , learning facts is also important .",,
2285,"However , usually facts are matters to support ideas or concept , therefore facts are supplyment for them .",support;supplyment,7;15
2286,"In addition , observing facts is interesting and students are attracted study by watching facts , yet after all students need ideas or concepts to study their interests deeply .",attracted;deeply,10;28
2287,"To conclude , ideas and concepts is a necessity for students to consider subject deeply .",deeply,14
2288,"On the other hand , facts are only one aspect of real phenomenon .",,
2289,"Hence , it is not difficult to say that leaning ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .",,
2290,"when we talk about successful people the first thing comes into my mind are scientists , inventors , person who is a pioneer in his specially , and many other examples , and as we can see the common factor between all of them is that they all started new things and ofcourse took great risks to do them .",into,10
2291,"so I totally agree that successful people do try new things rather than doing what they already know how to do well , although some may be successful by doing this but in my opinion they are not as successful as the pioneered ones or even close to them .",close,46
2292,"there are many factors that I thing results in making those people more successful than others , for example , when they start something new , they have very minimal or almost no competitors in the feild they are trying to do somthing in , even if there are competitors they still trying as they do .",,
2293,"another issue is that when somebody is inventing something new for example he will have the opportunity to be a legend for the whole world because simply if he succeed everybody after will follow , use or adapt his invention and he may be remembered for this for centuries even after he die and this is a great success .",legend;follow,20;33
2294,"another issue is that make me feel that they are more successful is the amount of work they do , they try harder and harder to come up eith new ideas and this required great efforts and cause high appreciation of there work un like the lower amount of work needed by already known things even though there are risks for them not to succeed , because it is not something anybody have ever tried to do or even thought about , i think that you will do nothing new if you did not do risk .",,
2295,so with all appreciation to those who are doing already known things i do think that those who try new intresting things and take that risks are the real successfull people .,,
2296,I totally agree the statmentYoung people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .,give,9
2297,I will evaluate with the following paragraphs .,,
2298,"Before I tell you my reasons , I state that what is mean by helping communities .",,
2299,For me it is working in society in your own time by free which means Volunteer .,own,9
2300,First of all nowadays young people have a lot of things to do in school .,,
2301,"For example a small test everyday , big exam once a month and Leaving certificate for end of the school which is really important for the colleage .",,
2302,What I mean is the young people must study for them and which takes enough a lot of time .,takes,13
2303,Hence it is difficult to have time for committees .,have,5
2304,The second reason is there is so many ways to having fun at the weekend .,having,10
2305,"In the past there were no Prikura machine taking pictures of yourself and freinds . , Shopping , Game Center and Disco .",,
2306,They are very popular for young people .,,
2307,Hence they are much prefer to do them instead of helping counties .,,
2308,Also in my opinion young people have an imagine for community which is too hard .,,
2309,"They care more about their fashion , the points in school , Celeblities , gossips and all .",,
2310,They never interested in the real societies .,,
2311,As you can see the society and people has been changed .,,
2312,In other words young people have things to do for themselves .,,
2313,Although I know that they are selfish and ridiculous opinions but that is why i beleive young people nowdays do not give enough him y,give,21
2314,If we talking about advertisements of goodsproducts the first thing to do is to Know what the producer or the seller wants to reach .,reach,23
2315,"He wants to sell his products , and he will do everything to reach his purpose .",reach,13
2316,Advertisement is one of method say to the customers Here I m ...,,
2317,and this is my product .,,
2318,Who sell products using advertisement trying to show its own product much better than they really are .,,
2319,"Doing that , They , the seller , try to attract the consumer , showing the best side of the products .",attract;side,10;17
2320,In particular there are two elements most important than the other used in an advertisement : price and quality of goods .,,
2321,Who work in the advertising field Know how to advertisement a product .,,
2322,For example using comparative advertisement method : say to the costumers that they products are different by the others .,,
2323,Another method is to say to the consumer that higher life is not complete without this or that or surely will be better .,complete,13
2324,My opinion is that advertisements is based on knowledgement of social and human science .,,
2325,"That is , Knowing what the major part of persons will think looking a good in a particular light or a particular color can be obtain his goal .",obtain,25
2326,We know human want what they imagine or wish .,,
2327,If the seller is able to advertisement his product in the way that the consumer want is target is reached .,target;reached,17;19
2328,"May be before to buy something , it will be better if everybody ask to ourself is what I m going to buy is like I see in the real and not what it seems in my mind .",,
2329,I that my opinion !,,
2330,"While some people say that there should be a tour give during the trip , I do not agree with the idea that going on a trip with a give is better than going alone .",,
2331,There are two reasons of this : being responsible and more chances to communicate with locals .,,
2332,Going on a trip make me more responsible person in many respects .,,
2333,"For example , I have to make a reservation by myself and handle difficulties that I face during the trip .",handle;face,12;16
2334,"If there is a tour give while taking a trip , I wiil rely on him or her too much and I will not do anything neede for the trip such as reserving a hotel .",rely,13
2335,"As a result , I will tend to be less responsible person .",,
2336,"In addition , If I got involved in troubles such as fighting , robbery , or getting lost , I would mamage the situation with my little skills of the language .",mamage,21
2337,"This experience will teach me how to overcome difficulties when I am alone , making myself resposible .",teach;overcome,3;7
2338,"By contrast , if you are with a tour give , he or her will all take care of you whenever you ask help .",,
2339,"Furthermore , individual trip or trip with out a give will offer me lots of opportunity to talk with locals .",offer,11
2340,"For instance , I can make any schedule that I want and hang out with people with I get to know there .",hang;out,12;13
2341,"If I go to an ethinic restaurants to have dinner and make friends with locals , I will enjoy entire trip with them communication each other .",,
2342,"However , in a trip with a give , you always have to be in a group of visitors .",,
2343,"In other words , you have fewer chance to talk with locals .",,
2344,"In conclusion , I prefer going on a trip alone to going with a give because individual trip will produce more chance to learn responsibility and communicate with local people .",,
2345,"Travelling in a group rather than alone is most of the time a difficult decision to take and it involves many personal and external factors : the place you intend to visit , your social preferences , your tolerance for being with other people for long lapses of time , the type of people that will come along for this long trip ...",tolerance,38
2346,and many others .,,
2347,I do agree that traveling in a group led by a guide is a good experience in most circumstances .,,
2348,"When I intend to visit a large city , an historical site or a country of which I do not speak the language , being led by an experienced guide and together with some traveling friends is essential for me .",,
2349,"I have the opportunity to learn more about the culture of the city or the country that I am visiting , while discovering pleasures i .e .",,
2350,nice restaurants or nice locations that I probably could not find with my little written guide .,guide,15
2351,"For example , when I was in Montreal with my husband we dragged our friends to a not pricy and excellent : restaurant following directions of our useful little guide .",dragged;guide,12;29
2352,"Surely the food was good , but the not pricy part needed to be discussed and our friends offered to pay prior to seing the bill .",,
2353,In visiting historical places the role of a guide is even more important .,,
2354,"Living in Venice for many years , I have always been impressed by the amount of information I didnotknow about the local churches , and , despite being a local , I enjoyed to join guided groups while walking through the churches .",,
2355,"Even when traveling in remote places , being in a protected group with a guide that is able to help you with the essential needs is wise .",protected,10
2356,"My aunt was in Mongolia for 3 weeks , living with comrades in a tent and drinking acidic milk with all her traveling companions , and , once back , she assured me that she would not repeat the same trip without a guide .",,
2357,Sometimes however traveling in a group may be frustrating .,,
2358,"It requires conciliating needs and desires of different people , while tolerating organizational and traveling issues .",conciliating;tolerating,2;11
2359,Probably a good traveling social attitude is the best way to face any trip and to enjoy a good guided trip .,face,11
2360,"And , as a last point , having a good guide makes all the difference !",,
2361,"I do not agree with the statement expressing the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , and this for a variety of reasons .",,
2362,"In the first place modern city planning is partially leading toward a horizontal , spread-out model of contemporary metropolitan areas .",leading;horizontal;spread-out,9;12;14
2363,"Examples of this trend are urban developments of cities like Los Angeles , Mexico City and San Paolo , which have spread over vast areas .",spread;over,21;22
2364,"This time of city growth is going to enhance the importance of the car in everyday life , as long as we need to take the freeway to go to the grocery store .",growth,4
2365,Moreover I do not see changes in culture that would cause people to buy fewer cars .,,
2366,"In fact cars are also important to plan our days as we want to ; so that even if it was more and more difficult to afford them , they would be still used because they would enable us to be more independent with what we want to do and when we want to do it compared to public transportation .",,
2367,"Cars are also a status symbol , and people are going to buy them not only because they are useful , but also because they can show theit status by owing a particular kind of car .",symbol,5
2368,"It is extremely important for us to move , and be where we want to be at the convenient time .",,
2369,"Cars and modern means of transportation such as buses and cheap flights allow us a grade of freedom in time and space that was not even dreamed in other eras , and this is not going to stop .",grade,15
2370,"Plus , cars can give us freedom of movement combined with independency from other - except in traffic jams .",give;jams,4;18
2371,This in my opinion is the reason why the number of cars circulating is not going to shrink in the close future .,shrink;close,17;20
2372,"I do not agree with this opinion because of these three reasons ; expenses to have a tour guide , not being able to communicate with local residents , and not being able to learn taking responsibilities and the real side of the place .",taking;side,35;40
2373,"First , it is expensive to have a tour guide compared to taking a trip on your own or in a group .",taking,12
2374,"It is not necessary to worry about the cost if the person is rich , however not very many people would like to spend too much money just on traveling because it is also important to spend money on souveniours or on the food .",,
2375,Therefore it is not necessary to have a tour guide .,,
2376,"Second , it is hard to communicate with local residents with a tour guide .",,
2377,"When taking a trip , it is a great opportunity to talk to the local residents because they may be able to tell you where good restaurants are or nice places where local people only know .",taking,1
2378,"Also , when traveling a foreign country , it is fun using a foreign language .",,
2379,"If you are traveling with a tour guide and he or she always does things for you , you might lose these opportunities .",lose,20
2380,"Third , the tour with a tour guide in a group can be fun with no learning and responsibilities .",,
2381,Taking trips can be a learning place .,Taking,0
2382,"You can learn about the people , culture , atomosphere , and the language where you visit .",atomosphere,9
2383,"When you are with a tour guide , you will only listen to the tour guide and your friend in the group , therefore these learning opportunities decrease compared to taking trips without a tour guide .",taking,30
2384,Also you will be dependent on the tour give so that you will not be able to learn as much as traveling alone .,,
2385,Let s travel alone !,,
2386,"You may be scared to travel alone , however there are so many things you can learn by taking trips on your own .",taking,18
2387,It is cheap to take trips without a tour guide and fun to get to know the local residents .,take,4
2388,You will also be able to learn many things by traveling alone .,,
2389,"Again , I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .",,
2390,I believe that a student should take care of both understanding concepts and leaning facts .,,
2391,Particularly I am firmly convinced that a good education should provide enough information to be learned and enough concepts to be understood .,firmly;provide,3;10
2392,"Depending on the class or the study sector , one of these aspects can be prevalent but I m sure they should be both present .",,
2393,"In an engineering faculty indeed a student should probably give more importance to concept understanding , while in a medicine faculty information , facts are more important .",,
2394,Non the less I believe that concepts require a lot of information to be understood and aslo facts can be learned after having understood some concepts .,require,7
2395,I can give an examples based on my personal experience .,based,5
2396,"I am a civil engineer , and of course I learned a lot of information during mu univeristy career .",,
2397,"These information , studied in math , physics and geometry classes , were essential for understanding how a bridge or a building react to loads or earthquakes .",,
2398,"Viceversa a medical doctor can make a good diagnosis , and understand what actually causes a certain disease only if he did learn the related symptoms in books .",,
2399,Some students give probably more importance to understand ideas because they find understanding easier and quicker than learning .,,
2400,"Studying can be in fact boring when it requires too much time , but i think this is not a good approach for reaching a good culture and especially for having an effective background education .",requires;approach;reaching;background,8;21;23;33
2401,As student and worker I am convinced that what we understand and learn in school or university i s the key factor of our future success in life .,key,20
2402,"Particularly I donotsee any chance of success for all the people that learn everything without understanding also something , because they would not be able to adapt their knowledge to the reality of their job .",,
2403,"Viceversa , and in conclusion , I donotthink that a person can do a good job if she has not a sufficient background of information learned in school or university .",background,24
2404,"At a first sight , it can be inferred that young people show no interest in helping their community and that they seem to have become more ego-directed , in order to prevent themselves from the duties that a society is asking them .",asking,41
2405,"A likely explanations might be that to help the community is no more seen as convenient as it used to be , as it is not rewarded enough .",rewarded,26
2406,"Young people donotfeel this as a duty , and think that the world would probably go on without no help from them .",go;on,17;18
2407,"Furthermore , young people seem to live for the present moment and not for the future , almost as they feel that the duties toward a society will not effect their own future , or the future of next generations .",,
2408,"But is most of the youngers seem to share these opinion , it is absolutely not true for all .",,
2409,"Some of them , who are likely grown up with strong ideals and a steady sense of tradition , still continue to putting their efforts to helping their community .",strong;steady;putting,10;14;22
2410,It might be that people living in small towns are easily influenced and touched by community problems .,touched,13
2411,Is not unusual for them to be prepared in helping because of the surroundings where they live in .,,
2412,"I wouldnotsay that youngers living in the cities are not able to do that , on he contrary , thanks to devices provided by the city , they can easily help communities if they are interested in .",devices,23
2413,"Compared to few decades ago , the modern society we are living in has , with no doubt , passed through a huge number of changing .",passed;through,19;20
2414,"Given that , it s hard to say which of them has really brought an improvement or a decrease in the quality of everyday life .",brought,13
2415,What is certainly true is that young people summarize the most important and common features of a society .,,
2416,Some people believes that in twenty years there will be a limit in the use of private transportation will be limited .,,
2417,I agree with this opinion .,,
2418,There are some reasons that suport this point of view .,suport,5
2419,"First of all , there is an increasment in growing rate of human new generations .",,
2420,this would probably let the government of the societies to limit the ability for people to use their own personal cars in the future .,,
2421,This one of the secession which might be taken by the society in the future as a solution to the predicted situation of the future living .,,
2422,We all know that these cars consume energy to work .,work,9
2423,"for today s situation , the cars are using gas as a main course of energy to work , so the using of this kind of transportation is controled by the avaliable amount of this energy course .",work,17
2424,"If the word is going to face the limitation of this sources of energy , there will be some new decisions to control the consuming of gas on the transportation .",,
2425,Limiting the use of this kind of private transportation can help alot in containing a good balance in the usage of such energy sources .,balance,16
2426,The population will be asked to use the public transportation such as buses and train .,,
2427,Another benefit of this decision will help alot in reducing the traffic problems and the crowded streets .,,
2428,"In some huge cities , the work places are spreaded every where .",spreaded,9
2429,Second thing there are mostly sopping malls and supermarkets every where .,,
2430,If the future cities will be like that there will be no longer need for personal transportation because the places are nearby and the using of cars and personal cars will be worthless sold,worthless,32
2431,I disagree with the statement and it is what I donotlike of the instruction system of my country .,,
2432,"I m studing engineering and I have to study a lot of things , a lot of ideas and concepts of difficult subjects .",,
2433,"My professors only explain concepts difficult to understand and , important too , to remember for the exam .",,
2434,"I see that there is something wrong because if I study very much for the exam and I barely remember a concept , two weeks before I canotremember that concept because I donotundertand it or because I havenota fact that can conduce me to remember the concept .",conduce,47
2435,"I think if a professor tell a fact or a story to support a main concept or idea I can using that fact or story to remember and , most important , to understand it .",support,12
2436,I can say this because I had a professor of ecology and he was very different from others professors .,,
2437,He only spoke about facts of little animals to reach the main concept of their reasons to leave a place .,reach,9
2438,Or for example he explained a chinese problem with the women population .,,
2439,He told that a chinese man can be considered a man only when his son put him in the ground for his death .,put,15
2440,"For this reason when a chinese man had a daughter he kills her because chinese government do not want families of more than five persons , so the women decreased .",,
2441,With these examples I understand and I remember ecology things after three or four years .,,
2442,"I think that is the best method to explain complicated concepts too , and it is a funny and not hard way to understand and remember things of different subjects .",,
2443,"Some people say that broad knowledge is better , but I believe tha to specialize in one specific subject is better for human lives .",broad,4
2444,"First of all , new things are innovated or discovered only by specialized knowledge in one specific subject .",,
2445,The cutting edge technologies or arts can bring about development of human lives .,cutting;edge,1;2
2446,"For example , robots which aid handicapped people were not invented without special research in a robot technology .",,
2447,"In the field of arts , the computer graphic which entertains many people in films or TVs can not invented without computer .",,
2448,This example clearly shows how the specialized knowledge contributes to the society .,shows;contributes,3;8
2449,"In addition , a worry that the society with only specialized people is biased and hard to live with is not true .",,
2450,It is because that various kind of people with special knowledge can complement each others .,complement,12
2451,"For example , many manufacture companies employ specialized people and make them research in special fields .",,
2452,"Sometimes those specialists produce strange things , but the specialists in other divisions can point out problems of the products .",,
2453,"Even if the odd products go out to a market , they donotsell .",,
2454,"Consequently , specialists realize they are wrong and improve their products , which leads to further innovation .",leads,13
2455,This example clearly shows that specialized knowledge does not always make biased society .,shows,3
2456,"Thus , people do not worry about that .",,
2457,"For the reasons pointed above , I am sure that specialized knowledge leads to better human life and should be respected more than broad knowledge .",leads;broad,12;23
2458,The world we live is full of variety and differences between people .,full,5
2459,"We share diffrent cultures , diffrent traditions , diffrent jobs , diffrent responsibilties .",,
2460,Everybody is diffrent for the others in his ways of expressing life .,expressing,10
2461,The world is a huge stage and nearly everybody is an actor .,stage;actor,5;11
2462,"To be able to communicate with each others we should know about each others interests , this is mainly based on what we air in our academic life .",,
2463,It s a vast subject list .,,
2464,"It s better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects simply because the society requires the variety , requires the change between all living humans .",broad,5
2465,This is to lead us to communication and communication is to lead us to knowledge .,lead;lead,3;11
2466,Imagine a persons life specialized in one specific subject only .,,
2467,"No variety , no communication , no expanded knowledge .",expanded,7
2468,"his is the type of persons who communicate with there resemblance only , or in most of the times they become the outsiders .",outsiders,22
2469,"COMPLETE isolation of the society , and this may lead to a public danger , or to suicide .",lead,9
2470,It s then preferable to be an open person .,open,7
2471,Meeting diffrent persons with diffrent intersts and charing diffrent aspects of life .,,
2472,"Image a man specialized in complete physics and only complete physics , can you draw a life for this kind or people ?",draw,14
2473,"it s very difficult for him to built a family , to communicate with his wife , children , neighbors , friends .",built,7
2474,"One step after the other they will turn to isolation , live and work outside society and thus a failure of life .",One;step;after;the;other;turn;outside,0;1;2;3;4;7;14
2475,We live in a absurd world with so much of diffrent desires and interests .,,
2476,I hereby agree with the statment above .,,
2477,It s much better to have a broad knowledge pf many academics subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .,broad,7
2478,"Life is an adventure , we live once , we should do what we feel is rite to do .",adventure,3

2480,"I really enjoy to plan my trips by myself or with my girlfriend , it s a sort of pleasure for me to make researches on the web about all the details such as traveling , housing and main destinations , so most likely I disagree with the given stimulus .",,
2481,When you experience a tour organized by somebodyelse there are many things which are not under your personal control .,,
2482,"Many important decision are often taken by the group and I donotreally like to vote on things when I travel , by contrary I like to spend time where it s more valuable accordingly to my taste and personal interest .",spend;valuable;taste,28;34;38
2483,In addition I think that a guided tour usually presents events which are designed for tourists .,,
2484,I still remember when I went to Thailand with my family in 1991 and the tour guide basically was always showing us cultural events and shows which were very far to be authentic expressions of the local habits .,far,29
2485,I prefer to manage my own time during the trips and donotbe bothered by any time constraints or scheduled appointments as usually happens with guided tour .,manage;constraints,3;18
2486,"Thus I really like the intimacy of a romantic trip with my girlfriend , so I will eventually consider other options when I ll be older .",,
2487,"Yes , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take rather than doing what they already know how to do well .",,
2488,"Life is rapidly moving , every thing is changing , life tomorrow will definitely be different from today , the wheel of technology is accelerating , communications have overtaken the stars , industrialization has progressed and every aspect of life is developing faster than anyone thought to be .",rapidly;moving;tomorrow;wheel;accelerating;overtaken;stars,2;3;11;20;24;28;30

2491,Suppose a physician that completed his study in 1980s .,,
2492,Imagine he has not kept up with the development of medicine and medication since then .,kept;up,4;5
2493,I believe that his patients will not recover as quickly as if they were cured by a doctor who always runs after new inventions and discoveries .,runs;after,20;21
2494,Imagine also an engineer who confines himself in what he had received at school or university .,confines,5

2501,What my personal experience provides is that society has a strong tendency to observe only the negative examples provided by the young people and that it is really hard to find free time to dedicate to others .,strong;find;free;dedicate,10;30;31;34
2502,Today society seems to love to notice only the bad examples of young people and unfortunately this phenomena usually brings to a strong critic to the young people in general .,strong,22
2503,"It is true that there is a quite big amount of young people who are pretty selfish and do not care at all about others , but only about their own good .",,
2504,"What is extremely important on the other hand , but that unluckily is noticed by the society just few times , is that there are many young people involved in , for example , volunteering activities .",,
2505,What is even more important is that this number would strongly increase if young people had more free time .,strongly;had;more;free,10;15;16;17
2506,"School is really hard and requires lots of efforts , many young people also dedicate some of their times to other activities like playing a musical instrument or learning a new language , they perhaps also need to rest sometimes and so it is easy to understand that finding a free afternoon to dedicate to others is not easy .",dedicate;finding;free;dedicate,14;48;50;53
2507,For this reason those young people who are engaged in volunteering activities must be admired by the society because they are able at the same time to care about their own good and that of the others .,,
2508,"I , for example , dedicate my Friday afternoon to help young children with their homework .",dedicate,5
2509,"This activity gives me a lot , but often I have to renounce to study in order to have time to do it .",gives;have,2;18
2510,"The amount of young people not involved in volunteering activies is big , but at the same the number of young people involved in these activities is big too .",,
2511,"These young people have to be admired because they are able , within a week full of things to do , to find time to dedicate to others .",full;find;dedicate,15;22;25
2512,Without question I agree the statement that young pepole need to participate in their community pew .,,
2513,"There are three resons for it : economical benefit , learning social ability and improving their personality .",,
2514,"Firstly , helping thir community is curly benefit to economic .",,
2515,"If they take part in a non-profit group such as the one keeping environment good condition , the government do not need to spend the extra money in order to improve the environment .",,
2516,Acording to the survey countries where people help their communities spend less money than countries where not so many pepole help their communities .,,
2517,"For these reasons , it is certain that we need to make young people help their comunities .",,
2518,"Secondly , helping communities enables teenagers to learn social ability .",,
2519,I used to help home which is for the old .,,
2520,"Before helping it , I did not know how to communicate with old pepole .",,
2521,"However , by helping them I begin to learn how to speak to old pepole and also I also understood that it is really important to talk with old people .",,
2522,"But for this experience , hardly would I learn social ability .",,
2523,"Lastly , young people are able to grow by helping community .",grow,7
2524,My brother was used to be really rude .,,
2525,"However , he become far more humane by doing it .",,
2526,"From this experience , I maintain that the more they take part in communities , the better their personality become .",,
2527,"For resons above , I would have to say that helping society is really important .",,
2528,"Nevertheless , recently young pepole do not spend time in taking part in communities .",spend,7
2529,"Consequently , they need to spend more time in participating in communities .",spend,5
2530,"Eversince the last century , the car , introduced by the worldwide-best-seller Word-T in the twenties , has become the most popular mean of transportation .",,
2531,And nowadays it has even become more than that .,,
2532,"Actually , the car is now much more than just a mean of transportation , it has become a real social attribute , the bigger your car is , the higher you are on the social ladder .",attribute;higher;ladder,21;30;36
2533,Reducing the number of cars does not only implies a change in our habits of transportation but a complete change in the way we think .,,
2534,Another example of the way the car has influenced our society are the american cities .,,
2535,The way these cities are built is nearly an ode the car ...,ode,9
2536,"It s too difficult to move without a car , but that doesnotmatter because cars are still cheap in the US .",,
2537,I donotthink twenty years will be enough a generation is twenty-five years for our society to change .,,
2538,"However , some issues could help .",,
2539,"Indeed , the environment and particularly the global warming have become major issues for our planet , and the car is one of the biggest pollution sources on the planet .",,
2540,"Furthermore , the planet is running out of oil , implying an expensive energy , and that s becoming more and more a problem .",running;out;of,5;6;7
2541,"However I am not worried for the future of the car , because new technology will overcome these difficulties .",overcome,16
2542,"We are nearly entering a new era , electric or even hydrogen engines will soon be availiable , leaving a bright future to the car .",entering;era;bright,3;6;20
2543,"Cars wonotdisappear , they re just entering into their revolution , that s it .",entering;revolution,8;11
2544,"When I was young I used to think that Aliens existed , well actually I do think they exist , and I thought that the first thing they ll see when arriving on earth would be our roads and our cars moving at any time of the day and night .",,
2545,For sure they would think that the inhabitants of earth would be cars ...,,
2546,Why would you want the inhabitants of earth to disappear ?,,
2547,"Although it must be said that there are young people who donotcare about their community , I think that , in general , new generations are keen on helping their towns and do it in a variety of ways .",,
2548,There are many young boys and girls who spend a lot of their time working for the poor and the disadvantaged .,spend,8
2549,"For example , in my country there are several associations that recruit personnel to drive ambulances and one of my best friends , who has a very demanding and time-consuming job , works there without compensation at least once a week .",demanding;time-consuming,27;29
2550,"Another friend of mine spends every Sunday serving meals to poor people in a church , and he often tells me that performing this service for the benefit of his community is very rewarding for him .",spends;rewarding,4;33
2551,But there are also other ways to help people ; skilled professionals can be of great help in certain areas .,,
2552,"A classmate of mine , who graduated from a medical school , is now part of an association called Doctors without boundaries that sends doctors around the world to help poor communities in less developed countries .",part;boundaries;sends;developed,14;21;23;34
2553,She was sent to Africa and provided medical assistance to many people .,,
2554,I think that a person like her is a clear sign that young people are willing to help the others and therefore can be relied upon to become active members of our communities .,clear;sign;relied;upon;active,9;10;24;25;28
2555,"In fact , if a young doctor is willing to help people in a remote country , one can be sure that she will be much more keen on contributing to the well being of her community .",remote;contributing,14;29
2556,"As for myself , I try to get involved in pro bono activities , too .",,
2557,"Since I am a lawyer , I was able to spend the past two years assisting poor clients who were involved in various kinds of litigations without charging them .",spend,10
2558,"So , the examples I see around me are , in my opinion , eloquent signs that younger generations are not less willing to help others in their communities than older ones .",eloquent;signs,14;15
2559,"I disagree with the statement , in order for a student to learn something and benefits from it in the future he needs to learn facts because facts are based on things happened in reality so when a student get to learn from a fact he will be able to face each negative point of the subject .",based;face,29;50
2560,"First , learning facts especially from history and literature men like shakespeare , road John , etc .",,
2561,will help the student to learn and be foretasted about the subject than just giving him what shakespeare wrote and requesting him to memorize .,foretasted,8
2562,Understanding ideas and concepts makes the student to hate the subject because he feels that he must understand and memorize so for him its a long process while learning facts is more helpful because its a study of reality that happened once in life to simultaneous people .,,
2563,"Second , as importance absolutely it is more important to learn facts because students have to know and feel about others who suffered previously before them and how were they able to reach their goals .",reach,32
2564,This way of learning will encourage students to know about these facts and also be able to learn them to their friends and other people .,,
2565,"Furthermore , some people may disagree the idea of learning facts and prefer understanding concepts while they dont think how will the student be able to understand all ideas because most ideas are unreal and many students hate to learn fake things such as science fiction , terror stories and so on .",unreal;fake,33;40
2566,"Third , another popular reason is that most of our education places follow the rules of understanding than learning facts , i dont think students are more reliable to this processs maybe if they try to learning process the educational zones would find a good reaction from the students .",follow;the;rules,12;13;14
2567,"In Conclusion , I advice all students so tha they enjoy educating themselves to learn facts , any given facts that would feed them in the future for them as individuals and to others as acknowledged students .",feed,22
2568,I can see no reasons to object it .,,
2569,But I would like to make it clear that this issue is limited to most of advanced countries .,clear,7
2570,It is needless to say that the infrastructures and facilities is not still prepared in most of developing countries .,,
2571,"Even if the conditions is getting better , it is far away from discussing in this point .",far;away,10;11
2572,"Any way , there are three principal reasons to support that I completely agree .",support,9
2573,"Firstly , other transportation systems such us a train and a plane have been developing in the matter of time and also in the matter of money .",,
2574,"Now , the number of trains is available everyday .",,
2575,"Of course about a plane , too .",,
2576,"Gradually , the cost has become cheaper than before .",,
2577,"Actually , I could fly to U .",,
2578,S by 300 dollars .,,
2579,It is much cheaper than before .,,
2580,"Secondly , from environmental point of view , people have changed their minds into preserving clean air .",changed;into;preserving,10;13;14
2581,This is largely due to the fact cars have influenced badly .,,
2582,"Lastly , the family structure has been changing .",structure,4
2583,"For instance , there many families which do not have their child in it .",,
2584,This means they do not need their cars to go away in more safer way .,,
2585,I know the importance of cars .,,
2586,"However , I would like to stress the advantages of environmental problem .",,
2587,"To sum up , I agree this idea .",,
2588,I disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .,,
2589,There are three reasons .,,
2590,"First , older people have much time than young people because after older people retired thier jobs , they can enjoy the second life slowly .",have;the;second;life,4;21;22;23
2591,"When they were working , they were so busy that they could not do what they want to .",,
2592,"Besides , they could not take many vacations .",,
2593,They can do things which they could not do when they were working because they have a lot of time .,have,15
2594,"However , young people donothave a lot of time .",have,6
2595,They have to go to school or work .,,
2596,Students have exams .,,
2597,They are received to study harder and harder for exams .,,
2598,"Second , they have more money than young people .",,
2599,"When they were working , they would save money for their future .",,
2600,"They can buy what they want , go where they want to and eat what they want to .",,
2601,"Finally , of course older people have experienced a lot of things .",,
2602,They know what they should do when a problem happens .,,
2603,They also know how to avoid a problem .,,
2604,"They would experience hard things that as if it seemed that they could not solve the problem , but young people have not experienced such a thing yet .",,
2605,"Even if young people have experienced such a thing , the number would much less than those of older people .",,
2606,"In my opinion the broad knowledge change about what a person will going to do because i think is very important to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects , the reasons of this opinion are : - if you have an a global knowledge you can have a lot possibility to choise a work and when you have a some difficult you are able to know better this problem and you have more possibility to resolving this problem because for any type of problem you are ready to resolve it .",broad;broad,4;23
2607,"May , if you have a broad knowledge of a one specific subject you are ready to test your ability with any problem of this specific subject and i think you can know every aspect of this subject without lot difficult .",broad;aspect,6;34
2608,"But in my opinion is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because you can have more alternative than one specific subject and if you want to change what are you doing , you doesn t have many problem and you are more free than if you are specialize in one specific subject .",broad,8
2609,I think this because i like change and i think that : the change of situation is very interesting and been in always situation is so boring and when a person is boring is not happy and he doesn t know the best situations during the life .,,
2610,i think one person hoe is specialized in one specific subject doesn t have a lot of means liberty because he have to think every day and every moment at the same think .,,
2611,Then if a person have a general broad knowledge he can be free and he is more happy than a person how in,broad,7
2612,I disagree with the idea of a society formed by selfish young people .,formed,8
2613,It s not completely true .,,
2614,"It depends on their family , their friends and their social background .",,
2615,"Indeed , if you lived in a family where your parents think only about themselves because they are concentrated only on their job , it would be difficult to think helping the communities .",concentrated,18
2616,"In this case , the son or the daughter usually thinks about her or his studies , toys , things , goods and not about the others who can need their help .",,
2617,"If I lived in a different family where my parents have taught me to help other people and also animals , the matter would change .",,
2618,We can start also from our home and our daily routine .,,
2619,"If I taught my son that it s important to help me doing something , he could do the same in other occasions when he is not at home .",,
2620,"If my son stayed at home in front of tv all the day and I said nothing about that , it could be negative for his sense of help and responsabilities .",,
2621,So all begins from the education .,,
2622,The education to help someone is the basis .,basis,7
2623,It doesnotdepend on young people but on their education .,,
2624,I have met in my life a lot of interesting young people who help every day their friends or people in need .,,
2625,"They always belong to a catholic society or have many strong values such as family , love , friendship , sacrifice and so on .",belong;have;strong;sacrifice,2;8;10;20
2626,They always believe in something : God or politic values .,,
2627,Or they believe in some atheistic theory such as communism .,,
2628,I never met generous and unselfish young people without strong values .,strong,9
2629,So where young people are not interested to help their communities is where there is a lack of important values .,lack,16
2630,I believe in some strong catholic values and I try in my free time to help other people in different ways .,strong;free,4;12
2631,I m a teacher and I work in some cases without earning in order to help some poor people .,,
2632,There is another important point and it always depends on education : young people sometimes have too many hobbies and appointments in a day and so there is no time left for helping people .,left,30
2633,"If a parent prohibited this kind of day routine , young people could be less busy and they could have more available time to help others in need .",have,19
2634,"In conclusion , in the souls of young people , there is the desire to help the communities and the adults have to help them to do that .",,
2635,I donotagree completely with the statement .,,
2636,I donotbelieve that in order to be successful people have to take risks or try new experiences .,,
2637,"I mean , it would be more correct saying that these kind of people are brave , but I really rather not to use the word successful .",,
2638,"Let me explain myself : it is extremely complicated to define what does it mean being a successful person , people have such different goals and perspectives in life that there is not a clear definition of the term !",perspectives;clear,26;34
2639,I can feel that I made it or that I am extremely successful for something that maybe would be seen as a total disaster from someone else s view .,view,28
2640,"So , I guess I admire both people who are always trying to make changes or experience new practices , and also , on the other hand , I truly respect those who feel much more confortable and self secure by repeating things they already know .",confortable;secure,36;39
2641,"However , I must confess ...",confess,4
2642,I think I am more a new risks every day type of woman !,,
2643,I love to feel the emotion when I donotfigure out what am I doing or I try all my best when it comes to dealing with new circumstances .,,
2644,"So , that is probably another reason why I donotsee as successful people who try new things : because I donotsee myself that way , using the word successful .",,
2645,"Maybe sometimes I wish I was wiser , more traditional and not afraid of everyday routine !",traditional,9
2646,"Even though joung people usually like enjoying themselves more than older people do , this is not necessarily true .",,
2647,"For exemple , you could meet a really cool sixty years old man that does everything in his power to have fun and make life worth of being lived , and a very boring twenty years old boy who will never step out of his house except to go to school .",in;power;worth,14;16;23
2648,"On the other hand , if it s true that joung people do enjoy life more , it could be because of the belief that one would better take advantage of its youth before it is too late .",take;advantage,28;29
2649,"I do not totally agree with that statement , in fact I think that people should have the courage of enjoy their whole life , without wasting all their chances while they are just teenagers or waiting too long to start following their dreams .",courage;wasting;following,18;26;41
2650,"Talking about real facts and people , I could nominate as many teens as older people that are enjoying their lifes .",,
2651,Today s world offers chances to have fun to people of all ages : there are a lot of parks and resorts where a child can go and enjoy a few days and where its parents would have a great time too .,,
2652,"Holiday resorts where my grandparents would love to spend a few week can be found almost anywhere , and of course there are a lot of structures that offer amusement to teens between 15 and 30 years old .",spend,8
2653,"So , if a person wants to enjoy its life , there is nothing keeping him from doing that .",keeping,14
2654,"Nevertheless , we will always meet someone who is not wanting to do any of these .",,
2655,"And if we really pay attention to it , we will find out that this kind of behavior is present in people of all ages , there in not a real average .",,
2656,"If one wants to have fun , he will do it , and if he doesnothe will not .",,
2657,"Maybe it s just another way of enjoying life , even though most people consider it boring and worthless .",worthless,18
2658,"I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because I believe that the people who have strong wish to be successful , are more likely to be successful .",strong,35
2659,My father is a business man who works for the Japanese company .,,
2660,"When I was young , my father s job was to trade oil , and the company asked him to go to NY with family to work there .",,
2661,"When I arrived NY with my mother and father , I was surprised because the other business man who worked there were at least 10 years older than my father .",,
2662,"I asked my mother why , and she told me that my father is one of a rare case .",rare;case,17;18
2663,"He always suggests new things and trys new things that the company has never done , so he is working with older people who is working much longer than my father .",,
2664,"When I heard of it , I thought it is good to challenge new things rather than only doing what I already know .",challenge,12
2665,There is another strong example which I have seen in television about a week ago .,strong,3
2666,I was watching the Japanese TV program which is about successful people in Japan .,,
2667,"On that day , they were showing about one singer who is very popular in Japan now .",,
2668,"In the program , he said that he was actually a business man when he was twenty years old , and suddenly he quit his job to be a singer .",,
2669,"He loses his job and had a very hard time until the famous music producer found him , but he said it was a priceless time which was crucial to his life , because he still remembers those times and he even wrote a song about that time .",loses;hard;priceless,1;8;24
2670,"Due to those reasons , I strongly belive that people who try new things and take risks will be successful .",strongly,6
2671,"Even though they have difficult time before being succeeded , you will learn things from that time for sure , and your success will be even more valuable .",difficult;valuable,4;27
2672,I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .,give,11
2673,"These days , many young people are just playing around and some of them are even being obstacle to others .",playing;around;obstacle,8;9;17
2674,"In my country , Japan , the unemployed young people is being a serious problem .",,
2675,They are the people who never goes outside and work .,,
2676,They often get food supplies and hobby goods from their parents .,,
2677,"These people are surely not helping their communities , since they just spend most of the time playing computer games .",spend,12
2678,"I have a friend that used to play a lot in childhood , but now that friend is staying in his house for all the day and doing nothing .",,
2679,"That friend s mother was saying that it would be great if he get out from his room and start searching for job , since the family s income is not sufficient .",,
2680,There is other case too .,,
2681,"Some young people in Japan spend their time just running around their neighborhoods with their motorcycles , usually with a very noisy sound of that motorcycles .",spend;running;around,5;9;10
2682,They can be very hostile and causes a lot of fights .,,
2683,"By those fights , public property could be destroyed , or other people might get injured too .",,
2684,I got injured by those people last week .,,
2685,"I was just standing in the park , waiting for my friend , and those people came saying that the park is their place , so never enter .",,
2686,"They punched me in face , and I was badly injured .",,
2687,"Young people should be the ones who help and develop their communities , but it is not yet achieved in my country .",develop,9
2688,I think those people who are being obstacle to others should stop harming other people or destroying public property at first .,obstacle,7
2689,"Then gradually , they can be helping their communities and could make it better .",,
2690,Every teacher has higher way to teach sudents and each teacher has his her technieqs in teaching .,,
2691,"One may let students to understand ideas , and one may let them to learn facts .",,
2692,"however , teaching students to understand ideas and concept deliver the information more easily to students rather than learning and memorising facts .",deliver,9
2693,Understanding ideas and concept is make the information or the details more clear to students .,clear,12
2694,"first , when a student is facing a new ideas and information , he may have no idea about the new topic .",facing,6
2695,And starting by learning the facts and memorising them will be hard on them and may lead to miss understanding for the topic .,lead,16
2696,"Whereas , when the teacher trys to explain how the concepts and the ideas where direvered from will make it easier for the student to learn .",direvered,15
2697,"for example , if the teacher gives students scientific work sheet and tells students that they have a test in the next day on the definitions , students will try to memories the terms without understanding for the roots or the details of the facts that are in the sheet .",roots,38
2698,"However , they will be confused about how the facts and the details are linked .",linked,14
2699,"And in that case the teacher should have have talk about the facts and teach the students how these facts works , because that might help in memorising the fact for a longer time period .",works,20
2700,"second , if the student learned for example , how the machine works , he will be more knowledgable about methods used to invent it .",,
2701,"Moreover , when the teacher uses technieqs that blows the student to think and how to understand the ideas this piece of information will last in higher head for along time and he can develope that new idea a year after a year .",piece;last,20;24
2702,Using this methode will produce aloof inventors and scientists .,,
2703,"To conclude , some students have the ability to understand more than memorising and the opposite is also true .",,
2704,"however , these two types of learning , depend on understanding ideas and concept .",,
2705,and it make it easier for students to learn .,,
2706,In twenty years time i dont think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .,,
2707,The way i see it is that in order to lessen the number of cars in use we have to come up with ways to make us less dependent on there use meaning that we have to come up with many new transportation way and systems that are sufficient and at the same time efficent enough to surve the public .,surve,57
2708,"there are a lot of examples for making good transportation methods that can be introduced although some had already been indeed intruduced but needs to be made more effect , satisfying and accessible for people .",introduced;intruduced,14;21
2709,one of those examples are trains and the subway systems that have been intoduced in a lot of countries but not in others beacause there too small or the country cant afford build and applying them .,intoduced,13
2710,another example is the use of the bus systems and again buses are used in a lot of countries but not every body would be intrested in using bus case they may seem uncomfortable and unsatisfactory .,,
2711,another good examples is the use of beycicles for transportation like whats been done in some of the highly populated poor countries .,,
2712,if the the goverments came up with ways to improve the transportation systems given in the examples and try to come up with even newer and more advanced ones i beleive we could see fewer cars in use in the future my argument is just that it will probaly take more than twenty years to see that happening THE END,take,49

2721,"On the other hand , the presence of a tour guide would inevitably make the journey very precise and strictly scheduled without allowing for the possibility of errors and unexpected situations .",strictly,19
2722,"This combination of failures and successes makes me feel part of the place I am visiting and , at the same time , it gives me the incredible opportunity to get in touch and talk with many people .",part;in;touch,9;31;32
2723,The contact with locals is crucial in the discovery process of the travel and the presence of a tour guide would undermine a lot the ability to interact with other people .,discovery;undermine,8;21
2724,For all these reasons i strongly believe that traveling alone or with a group of good friends led by themselves is the best way of enjoying and taking advantage of the full potentials of a journey .,strongly;full;potentials,5;31;32
2725,I completely agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .,,
2726,"Most of the advertisements describes their products as they are the best in the market , without any considerations to any side or bad effects in its use for any human or any specific group such as children or eldest .",,
2727,"At the same hand , most of the advertisements consider the financial margin as the most priority rather than other important factors that might affect the whole human health , such as incidents used for specific products that might cause cancer , allirgey , and diabetes .",margin,12
2728,"In my own expereince , I used to have RedBull an Energy Drink as my daily drink to empower and keep my self awake for as long as possible due to my long working hours shifts .",,
2729,Two year later I read an article by chance followed with an internet research showed that all this type of drinks are a slower killers more than an energetic drinks !,slower;killers,23;24
2730,"it has a Stroptroin more than any thing else , and the research showed that more than one cup a day might cause to a heart attack and to a few cases of addiction to it .",,
2731,"But what makes this Red Bull is the most famous energy drink , is the advertisements and campaigns all over the world showing its one side effect Angry hiding all other negative side effects that might cause our lives especially our youth !",hiding,28
2732,"It is not a problem to have these products in hour hands , but the disaster is that we need the proper awareness that tells us what exactly it is about .",disaster;tells,15;24
2733,"We need to read and keep educating ourselves with these kinds of products , and to try as much as posible to select what is more suitable to our use and health .",,
2734,"I totally agree with this statment , when a person gets a broad knowledge he can join all debates and can open conversations with all types of people , I would like to get a broad knowledge cause it will also make me look smart and well educated person and thats one of my goals in life .",broad;open;broad,12;21;35
2735,"to be specialized in one specific subject is also a good thing it will make you a proffional in a specific subject , but when you it comes to society they will choose a person with a broad knowledge than a person with a specified knowledge , because they think that the one with more knowledge is more educated and when you talk to him he can understand whats the situation or whats the question , talking to a person with broad knowledge gives you more chances and more opportunities to have more subjects to talk to that person with , but when you are specialized with only one subject it makes you stricted allthough you might be a profficional in that subject .",broad;broad;stricted,37;81;113
2736,"A person can be educated and can be called intelligent when he is familiar with all subjects , for example a lawyer will understand his customers situation more when he goes in details with the persons personality by using physiology as trying to analyze the persons problem and situation . a person with more knowledge is the person who used his life and his time by using every second trying to learn more knowledge .",used;using,59;66
2737,I as a person would like to talk to a person with a broad knowledge than talking to a person with a specific knowledge because i can gain more information from the person that have a broad knowledge .,broad;broad,13;36
2738,"However , i also like to be a person with a broad knowledge so i can be able to talk with all people and not to freak out not knowing what to do when a person comes to talk to me asking me about a subject rather than telling him i have no idea , i would love to answer his question with a good answer .",broad,11
2739,"In conclusion , from my point of view i totally agree to this statement because it makes sence to me also as the reasons that i mentioned above makes me belive more in this statement .",,
