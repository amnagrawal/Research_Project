431,In this case the most of the time the films whose trailers I watched seem wonderful and I often decide to go and see them ; but when I am in the cinema I understand that the trailer during its sixty seconds presents to me a collage of the best scenes of the film but the other dozens of scenes are bad,collage,46
432,After that there is an evolution in watching or listening advertisements ; after that people recognized the typical ways societies use to make a product seem better than it really is,evolution,5
433,They do make lots of goods more appealing and colorful or handy,appealing,7

435,The truth reveals when you buy it and us it,reveals,2
436,Although advertisement is important to a new products in the market to show people a new line of food computers or services,line,16
437,It does not require to run the advertisement too many times a day,run,5
438,I think that any good reliable goods and services will eventualy control the market regardless of how many times other products would run their advertisements because they will fail in the selling process as long as they are not as good,control,11

440,When I want to buy a computer for example I think first of Dell although there are lots of other popular brands which they have lots of advertisements that run several times on several TV canals and even on the newspapers,run,29
441,I guess leaning from personal experiance is way more valiable than all the nice things you see and hear about a products in an advertisements,valiable,9
442,The service that I had before was not reliable and nothing even close to what they advertise,close,12
443,Like losing the signal,losing,1

449,Total wast of money unless they expect from me to travel to other state to have a dinner,wast,1
450,I agree with that statement because learning facts are based on understanding ideas,based,9
451,Students can not learn new facts without knowing where they came from or what corroborate them,came,10

453,there has to be a base for everything someone learns or it wont be considered learning,base,5
454,My favorite subject has always been Math because unlike subjects like History and Literature its all based on logic,based,16
455,everything has an explanation and acknowledging that explanation leads to acknowledging a new fact,leads,8
456,When students understand ideas they become more productive and more accomplished because grasping and analyzing ideas leads to creative which leads to creation,grasping,12

462,If someone thinks about the technology that is enhancing everyday and the growth of our economies it will be clear that it is the cause of knowledge knowledge that is not only obtained by memorizing facts but by creative minds,obtained,32
463,Wouldnt that have been easier if the point was nt to make students understand what they re taking in school,taking,17
464,It is not easy to say which is the better approach but I personally do not agree with the statement because I think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject,approach,10
465,It is not easy to say which is the better approach but I personally do not agree with the statement because I think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject,broad,25
466,I mean if you can concentrate on one subject it will be easier for you to learn lots of things on that subject and you will be able to become prepared,concentrate,5
467,But when I say more practical I refer also to the fact that studing one subject instead of more than one is good for the student s path,path,27
468,I mean once a student has entered the subject he should know what that subject requires what the important aspects are and he would be able to organise his studies in the best way,entered,6

487,A tour guide can be useful and informative but this also takes your agency of deciding what to see where to go,takes,11
488,The best part of traveling in a group with a tour guide is the safety and the less effort you need to gather information about the place and information for ensuring the safety,gather,22
489,But this is also the worst part of traveling in a group in that it eliminates positive accidents,eliminates,15
490,By positive accidents I mean your opprotunity to meet people find a great shop or street by accident find a new things about the place which may not be marketed in the mainstream tourism,mainstream,32

498,Some may say the trouble it takes to gather information about the place on higher own is too much and it is better to leave the job to the tour guide,gather,8
499,However recently there are so many books and websites about traveling alone or as a couple but without any guide that are easily accessble that the things I mentioned above about getting around on your won can be easily found in a book such as Lonely Planet,accessble,23

504,I definitely needed a car in order to survive there,survive,8
505,Considering that cars are currently one of the major transportation tools among people in developed countries I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today because twenty years is just not enough time,tools,10
506,To replace the existence of cars with other means of transportation would take more than twenty years to accomplish,take,12
507,If the city made a law prohibiting the use of a car this would sure drive the person to quit driving the car but making that law in use would take more than twenty years,drive,15
508,Imagine the voices that would come about from the people when a plan to make this law arises,voices,2

528,I will explain my opinion by going through the purpose of advertisement how it works and some practical examples of how it could actually improve a product or just how it could only make it seem better,going,6
529,The purpose of advertisement is to express one or more ideas related to the product that is advertised in order to increase the appreciation of the product and therefore to convince to buy it or eventually just to agree with the message the advertisement wants to communicate,message,41
530,The final image that the advertisement gives about the subject could be true or false bad or good but anyway if the product is ment to be just a carrier of that image or cluster of ideas associated the advertisement is functional to the improvement of the product,image,2

533,Examples of a product meant to carry an idea are generally status symbols or fashion products,carry,6
534,Typically a purse or a very expensive watch have basic functions regarding their original purpose but these objects are mostly considered for what they look like and the sensation they give due to esthetic values that determine the quality of an image in fact they could even not be functional but still used,image,41
535,The advertisement increases or eventually refines the ideas associated with the object so that the messages advertised are totally functional with the product,increases,2

585,In some cases the growth rate has increased too,growth,4
586,Therefore I would be tempted to say that I disagree with statement,tempted,4
587,Therefore there are elements that could certainly discourage the use of private cars and encourage the use of public transports,elements,3

598,Young people have a lot of lifetime healthy and have many good communities,have,2
599,The first reason is that they have a lot of lifetime,have,6
600,Therefor young people like my age 25 years old we have more about 50 years lifetime,have,10
601,We can buy a lot of things with money ; however we ca nt buy any time,buy,14
602,The third reason is that young people have a lot of community,have,7

615,I strongly believe that this is extremely dangerous for the young spectators who are particularly sensitive to these aspects and have not a defined personality yet so they are easily convinceable,dangerous,7
616,I strongly believe that this is extremely dangerous for the young spectators who are particularly sensitive to these aspects and have not a defined personality yet so they are easily convinceable,defined,23
617,Moreover some could be dangerous even for adults for example the advertisements on diet products which are provided with false witnessing and interviews which explains how many weight they have lost in so little time,dangerous,4
618,In conclusion I think that the only function of advertisement should be that of making the consumer aware of the creation of a new product and not to overwhelm him with false and useless information although the consumer should be however critic,overwhelm,28
619,I think that commericals always inflate what products really are,inflate,5
620,I was very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day,throw,10
621,Unfortunately false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers,lead,3
622,Unfortunately false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers,waste,6
623,Unfortunately false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers,loss,10
624,The first reason of this is that because older people have more time and money than their counterpart they can do a lot of activities they want to,have,10
625,They have a lot of free time than I have,have,1
626,They have a lot of free time than I have,free,5

630,On the contrary I have to work every day and I have less available time and money since I got a job last year,available,13
631,Another reason is that young people have more concerns about their futures compared to the optimistic opinions showed by older people which leads to the young people s negative ideas about their lives in general,have,6
632,Another reason is that young people have more concerns about their futures compared to the optimistic opinions showed by older people which leads to the young people s negative ideas about their lives in general,leads,22
633,Now that the aging society in my country is getting serious young people may not receive enough money to live on after their retirement,on,20
634,My consideration with respect to the available time and money as well as the negative ideas about future lives I think that older people enjoy life more than younger people do,available,6
635,It s absolutely compressible that a company wants seem an his product better than it really is ; a company in fact have to see multiple factors like for example the actractivity of the market the other concurrent companies and in this situation the impact with the customers is fundamental,actractivity,31
636,It s absolutely compressible that a company wants seem an his product better than it really is ; a company in fact have to see multiple factors like for example the actractivity of the market the other concurrent companies and in this situation the impact with the customers is fundamental,impact,44
637,But I repeat that this is the market law so the companies ca nt make in other terms,law,8
638,I think the positive way of this process is that a good product can have a lot of visibility wih the advertisement,visibility,18
639,My mind goes for example to Linux an alternative software ; most of IT s experts say it s better then Windows but it does nt have the necessary visibility and many other factors for example Linux is not organized as a company like his concurrent to fight it,goes,2

642,In many cases I have choosen a product for the fantastic advertisement of that product ; I like very much Coca - Cola I ever buyer it probably I d prefer Pepsi but I have never buyer it because I m a fanatic customers of Coke in part for his beautiful advertisements that remind me when was a cold,fanatic,42
643,another advertisement was talking about some food and they say it is very healthy and good for your body do i buy it too but after i try it i dont thing i feel any changes,talking,3
644,but the we ca nt say about advertisements always make thair products better than they really are and in the same time we can not say the opposite because we have the to faces honest advertisements and dishonest advertisements,faces,33
645,Ideas and concepts are the base for a theory or a sociological movement but if you don t remember facts date and names to expose in a discussion how can you explain or make other people s ideas changing,base,5
646,But as I saw in my life everything must pass thru practice to really understand the value and the importance of lots of theories studied in the past,pass,9
647,But as I saw in my life everything must pass thru practice to really understand the value and the importance of lots of theories studied in the past,thru,10
648,If I should explain people how do work all the forces interested in that phenomenon it would take much more time than making an experiment of an object maybe an apple,forces,10
649,Surely now that I ve practiced the theory I can better understand all the concepts behind the main idea,behind,15
650,In history there was a lot of important facts and if we don t try to study and understand the psychology behind some characters of an event we can t surely have an our own opinion about it so we see that are important the ideas,behind,21
651,But if we don t care about the timeline in which the facts happened we risk to lose the most important informations of when where they happened,lose,17
652,Then I believed Japan need to adapt the policy of soil democracy like many European countries because recently the employment in Japan have been unstable although Japanese MNCs have increased thier sales and government has decreased the corporation tax,unstable,24
653,So I believed the welfare system in Europe is better than American small government and strong capitalism,small,12
654,So I believed the welfare system in Europe is better than American small government and strong capitalism,strong,15
655,In the theory each person has same right under the law but one day I saw the situations where two black men were rejected by the shop to enter in UK,under,8
656,In Europe I found that if the government try to protect the people s lives people are not independent about thier lives,protect,10
657,Besides I lost many desires to work or study in Europe because many people are so easy going about life because thier lives are protected by the government,lost,2
658,Besides I lost many desires to work or study in Europe because many people are so easy going about life because thier lives are protected by the government,easy,16

660,Besides I lost many desires to work or study in Europe because many people are so easy going about life because thier lives are protected by the government,protected,24
661,It was so schocking experience for me because when I had studied political philosophy in Japan I believed that the social democracy is necessary for Japan,schocking,3
662,So in conclusion I strongly disagree with the idea that understanding the concepts or ideas is important than learing the facts,strongly,4
663,For example since online shopping is getting more and more common sometimes I have to buy things only judging from the information provided by the advertisement and I received a completely different thing from what I expected from the advertisement,judging,18
664,It is a good example to allow the consumers to get the real impression of the products,get,10
665,As a result customers know that advertisements have a tendency to promote only their good sides and companies know that it is not enough only to provide good images,sides,15
666,Many people might find specialization a convincing and advanced position especially in the modern business world,advanced,8

668,It appears to me however that those who have broader knowledge of many academic subjects who might be called generalist will be getting more and more important,broader,9
669,In this marketing stage the importance of those who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be clearly identified because such people have a variety of perspectives based on the academic backgrounds and can approach the possible customers from various angles,broad,10

678,In this context a company is highly likely to regard those who have broad knowledge based on many academic subjects as potential candidates for good managers or finally future board members,broad,13
679,In the reasons stated above I believe those who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are more highly appreciated than are those who specialize in one specific subject especially in the future business world,broad,10
680,I agree to the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities,give,11
681,There are three reasons supporting my idea ; no free time for young people no space for them to help the society and lack of relate experience with others,supporting,4

690,Increasing in number of the cram school especially the one for young people creamy shows the fact that many young people are spenting most of their time to study,spenting,22
691,Second there are no space or role for them to help the society,space,4

699,Finally young people lose their chance to have the experience of good co-relationship with others,lose,3
700,Because of the lower rate to get job people are competing all the time ; there are many enemys for the young people,competing,10

714,In my opinion is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of a specialization in one of them,broad,7
715,I say this because I think that is the best solution in order to find a work in today s society where companies are continously on change and require a huge flexibility and adaptability for the new works,flexibility,31
716,According to this school must provide to give a radical instruction teaching many different subjects,provide,5
717,In this way each student will have a quite complete background in the field he choose,complete,9
718,But I also think that an high level of specialization could be reached only with years and years of study and work and school ca nt give this opportunity to everybody,high,6

723,After the school I can specialize myself in Web design by work because I have a radical preparation that school gave me and in the same time the other students in my class could choose another specialization according to their preferences,gave,20

967,To give my family s example when my grandfather started new business in any fields he always reached about the failure examples conducted by other people because failure example taught him why these businesses were not successful,taught,29
968,He was so prudent that he could make his success without taking any risks,make,7
969,One example that comes to mind quickly is the Japanese internet shopping site so-called Taken,comes,3

982,But on the other hand there are some young people to have enough time to help their comunities,have,11
983,As I mentioned above I know some people have enough time to help their comunities even if they are very busy,have,8

986,It is a fact that if the students do not understand a concept and do not understand the ideas the things surrounded by them would not make any sense and there wouldl be a confusion,surrounded,21
987,At the same time it is also important to learn facts which make the things real to the students and students can easily visualize the things and can develope their own thoughts and ideas,visualize,23
988,When the student can see the fact they can accept a reality they face develope their ideas and think deely and as the result they will be more independent,see,4

998,I also could use my imagination and so my thoughs got really deep,deep,12
999,Form my personal experience I found it was much better to learn facts as my attitude gets more active and more independent from what the teacher teaches me a concept,active,18

1031,I do agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities,give,9
1032,This is because by thinking about myself and friends around me I can not find many young people who are interacted to the community a lot,around,9
1033,When my grandparents are young they said they remembered that their parents were interacting with the community deeply and felt normal that they had to live in that way,deeply,17
1034,At the time when my grandparents are little the Words War II was happening therefore strong bond in the community was needed more than nowadays,strong,15

1037,I also do not remember my parents teaching me to interact with community and spend time for it,interact,10

1048,There are so many factors leading to the decrease in the number of cars,leading,5
1049,However there are other factors promoting the use of cars and thus will result in more number of cars in the future,promoting,5
1050,One reason that may lead to the increase in the number of cars used is the increasing number in population,lead,4
1051,Another reason is the advancement in Science,advancement,4
1052,Having a cheap energy source decreases the running cost of owning a car and thus encourages more people to purchase and own cars,encourages,15
1053,Last but not least the advancement in technology is another key reason,advancement,5
1054,Last but not least the advancement in technology is another key reason,key,10
1055,Advancement in technology will increase the number of cars significantly,Advancement,0
1056,With technology advancing car manufacturers are able to lower their cost of production for cars,advancing,2

1060,I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities,give,11
1061,Firstly young people seem to be busy with their own life and has less interest in their own communities,busy,6
1062,Firstly young people seem to be busy with their own life and has less interest in their own communities,with,7
1063,There they study on subjects they have interest in and they may also be participating in a circle or an after school activitiy,circle,17
1064,It can be guessed that young people spend more time there instead of helping out at local communities,spend,7
1065,The problem of Japanese society now is that the local communities are not working out in many places because people have less contact with their neighbors,working,13
1066,The problem of Japanese society now is that the local communities are not working out in many places because people have less contact with their neighbors,out,14
1067,You might see some people once in a while but in a busy life there is rarely a chance to really get together to form a community,form,24
1068,Therefore young people do not spend time to help out in their communities,spend,5
1069,Lastly the local communities are mainly run by older people such as people who have retired jobs and have more time,run,6
1070,Lastly the local communities are mainly run by older people such as people who have retired jobs and have more time,have,18
1071,These people gather and organize community activities and spread it to neighbors,spread,8
1072,For example it takes time to organize an event in the community,takes,3
1073,When there are not enough people you struggle more and have to work harder,struggle,7
1074,So it is natural to say that people who have more time has more chance to participate and help out in the community,have,9
1075,This might be one of the reasons that youg people spend less time in community when compared with older people,spend,10
1076,From these three points that I have stated above I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities,give,17
1077,Young people might be energetic and be a big help but when their interest is somewhere else it is difficult to bring back their attention,somewhere,15

1081,First our time is restricted by a tour guide,restricted,4
1082,It is hard for us to spend because ew have to write reports about the place so we have to be led by a tour guide even we do nt like it,spend,6
1083,I strongly believe there are advantages as well as disadvantages in all phases of life in youth as in old age,phases,12

1318,First of all we should learn from history and from our recent past that many successful people tried innovative things instead of continuing doing the usual and their creativity and courage to take risks has been prized,prized,36
