I do not agree nor disagree with the statement . 
Traveling with a group led by a toure guide is intresting , the tour guied will stat information about the place we are visiting , so we can M_get knowledge on the place . 
Also he is an expert with the famous places which M_attract visitores from different countries , so we can denifit from his expierience . 
Furthermoe , we will guarantee that we did not M_miss anyplace with in the tour . 
The beautiful part in traveling with group is we can M_share information about different cltuers from people all over the world . 
i like to learn about cultures it is very intresting to find that some beleives that are forbbiden in some cultures are allowed in others , therefore when people visit other countries will knoe how to react with some people . 
For example certain words are allowed to be used in me country but not allowed in other contries , so when I visit that other country I would say a wored that would cause a big trouble for me On the other hand , when traveling in a group the individuals will be M_tied M_up with the group , sometimes we need to M_spend some family time to explore the country weare visiting and try some restaurants , M_spend more time in a musiem and buy some sevoniers . 
In my opinion I will try both traveling ina group led by a tour guide or travel alon with my family , because each one of them has its own experience and adventure that we can M_keep wonderfull memorise in our mindes , i would like in some day to visit all the lovley places that i heard from people . 
Each individual has a different M_point M_of M_view , and every person will make the right selection for themselves to enjoy what they can to make good times las
